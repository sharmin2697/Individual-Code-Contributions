('Sharman License') and Ms Nicola Anne Hemming ('Ms Hemming') are each the subject of asset preservation orders made by Wilcox J on 22 March 2005 ('the Mareva orders')\", \"When referring to the applicants generally, I will do so as 'the Sharman applicants'\", \"Each of the Sharman applicants was one of ten respondents to infringement of copyright proceedings brought by the present respondents ('the Music companies') in respect of the operation of what was described by the parties as the 'Kazaa system' ('the primary proceedings')\", 'Wilcox J made orders ancillary to the Mareva orders on 22 March 2005 requiring each of the Sharman applicants to disclose on affidavit the description and value of all of their assets, wherever situated, and to specify whether those assets were held by each applicant either beneficially or in trust for any other person or entity', 'Wilcox J delivered judgment on the complex issues of liability arising in the primary proceedings on 5 September 2005 ( Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd (2005) 220 ALR 1)', \"In the meantime, Ms Hemming had filed two disclosure affidavits pursuant to Wilcox J's orders of 22 March 2005 whilst Sharman License and Sharman Networks had unsuccessfully sought several stays on various grounds of that same order insofar as it applied to them (see Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 406 per Hely J, delivered 8 April 2005; Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 441 per Wilcox J, delivered 15 April 2005 and Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 505 per Moore J, delivered 28 April 2005)\", 'Disclosure affidavits were eventually sworn on behalf of Sharman License and Sharman Networks by Mr Gee on 19 April 2005, which were later superseded by further affidavits sworn also by Mr Gee on 16 June 2005', \"Sharman License and Sharman Networks had also unsuccessfully sought an enlargement of time in which to file an application for leave to appeal from Wilcox J's orders of 22 March 2005 (see Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 per Lindgren J, delivered on 17 June 2005)\", 'On 24 May 2005, the Music companies filed a further amended notice of motion seeking further orders ancillary to the Mareva orders, which application was heard over several days by Moore J and determined by his Honour on 17 November 2005 substantially in favour of the Music companies ( Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 1587)', 'The Sharman applicants acknowledge that the orders made by Moore J pursuant to that determination were interlocutory in nature', \"What had led to the Music companies' application for those ancillary orders were deficiencies in the asset disclosure affidavits provided by the Sharman applicants pursuant to the ancillary orders of Wilcox J made on 22 March 2005\", \"It is from Moore J's interlocutory judgment of 17 November 2005 that the Sharman applicants presently seek leave to appeal, pursuant to O 52 r 10(2) of the Federal Court Rules\", \"The principal orders made by Moore J on 17 November 2005 were as follows:   '1\", 'The applicants have leave to cross examine [Ms Hemming] on the affidavits filed and served by her in response to Order 5 of the orders of Wilcox J made on 22 March 2005, on such matters as the Court may later direct', '[Ms Hemming] file and serve, within such time and [sic] the Court may specify, an affidavit that discloses with particularity the description and value of all the assets of [Sharman Networks] (and its subsidiaries within the meaning of section 9 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that are wholly owned) wherever situated and specifying whether those assets are held by [Sharman Networks] (or such wholly owned subsidiaries) beneficially or in trust for any other person or entity and further specifying:     a. in the case of any bank accounts which [Sharman Networks] (or such wholly owned subsidiaries) controls, the name of the bank in which the account is held, the name of the branch, the name of the account, the name of a person in whose name the account is held, the account number, and the balance of the account as at the date of service of the orders;   b. the name and address of any person or entity who holds any assets on trust or as nominee for [Sharman Networks] (or such wholly owned subsidiary);   c. details of any trust or arrangement pursuant to which such assets are held;   d. details of any charge, mortgage or other security grouped in relation to any asset; and   e. details of any contracts entered into for the sale, mortgage, charge or other disposition of the assets or any part thereof or interest therein', 'Order 1 made by Wilcox J on 22 March 2005 is varied by inserting before the words \"other than\" the following words:   (and, as to [Sharman Networks], be restrained from causing or permitting any wholly owned subsidiary to dispose of, to remove from Australia or to deal with in any way any of that subsidiary\\'s money, property or other assets in or outside Australia)\"', \"'   5 The immediate background to much of the debate presently raised by the Sharman applicants, and as a consequence the principal focus of their attack upon the orders of Moore J below, concerned the existence of alleged shortcomings in the asset disclosures, and in particular the implications of a payment of $1,116,405.63 made by Ms Hemming to a Vanuatu company, Trustees International Limited ('TIL'), following upon the sale of the Sydney residence of Ms Hemming and Dr Kilmer-Barber for $2,100,000 on 4 February 2005, being a payment made purportedly by way of repayment of a loan\", \"The Music companies' case presented to Moore J below was that there was in fact no such antecedent loan, that the transfer of such funds by Ms Henning to TIL in Vanuatu constituted a sham loan repayment, and that such funds have therefore continued to be her own moneys on the footing presumably of a constructive trust, and should have been identified as such in her affidavit of disclosure of her assets made pursuant to the Mareva orders\", 'Although Moore J declined to make a finding in relation to the issue as to ownership of that fund, his Honour formed the view that he would permit cross-examination of Ms Hemming on matters concerning the fund, by reason of doubts attending the same', \"His Honour reasoned in that regard at [37] of his reasons for judgment as follows:  'In all, real doubts arise about, and uncertainty surrounds, the reason why this transaction took place when it did and whether the monies transferred to TIL were, in truth, in satisfaction of a loan or continues to constitute an asset of, and requires disclosure by [Ms Hemming]\", 'Greater clarity about this matter may arise from the cross-examination of [Ms Hemming]', \"'   Legal principles informing the grant of leave to appeal  6 Section 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) stipulates that an appeal shall not be brought from a judgment of the Court constituted by a single judge, being a judgment that is interlocutory in nature, unless the Court or a Judge gives leave to appeal\", \"Although s 24(1A) does not purport to qualify or limit the Court's discretion (see Dcor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 399 in the joint reasons for judgment of Sheppard, Burchett and Heerey JJ), the Courts have developed general principles which inform the exercise of the discretion to refuse or grant leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment\", \"The rationale for those principles is the public interest in the efficient administration of justice, and the maintenance of 'the integrity and vigour of the procedures of the court, including as they do, the immediate involvement of the judge at all stages in the progress of cases to trial' ( Bomanite Pty Ltd v Slatex Corp Australia Pty Ltd (1991) 104 ALR 165 at 173, per Gummow J)\", 'One consequence sought to be avoided is the expansion of expensive and delaying pre-trial litigation involved in appeals on issues of practice and procedure, and the concomitant reduction in the authority of the trial judge, should such appeals be frequently entertained ( Bomanite at 176, per French J)', 'At least for those reasons, this Court has held on a number of occasions that typically a party seeking leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment ought to establish, first, that in all the circumstances, the decision from which leave is sought to appeal is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant the same being reconsidered by the Full Court, and secondly, that substantial injustice would result if such leave was to be refused, supposing the decision to have been wrong: see Dcor at 398', 'That those two questions were the touchstone of exercise of discretion in matters of this kind was common ground between the parties', \"I observe that it is well accepted that those criteria are not to be applied rigidly or fixedly, and the Court must bear in mind all of the circumstances of the particular case: see in that regard Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited v Phillip Morris Incorporated [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 177, where Gibbs CJ, Aickin, Wilson and Brennan JJ said:  'For ourselves, we believe it to be unnecessary and indeed unwise to lay down rigid and exhaustive criteria\", 'The circumstances of different cases are infinitely various', 'We would merely repeat, with approval, the oft-cited statement of Sir Frederick Jordan in re the Will of F B Gilbert (dec) (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 318 at 323:     \"...I am of the opinion that...there is a material difference between an exercise of discretion on a point of practice or procedure and an exercise of discretion which determines substantive rights', 'In the former class of case, if a tight rein were not kept upon interference with the orders of Judges of first instance, the result would be disastrous to the proper administration of justice', 'The disposal of cases could be delayed interminably, and costs heaped up indefinitely, if a litigant with a long purse or a litigious disposition could, at will, in effect transfer all exercises of discretion in interlocutory applications from a Judge in chambers to a Court of Appeal', '\"    ...It is safe to say that the question of injustice flowing from the order appealed from will generally be a relevant and necessary consideration', \"'  8 It was the Music companies' contention that the orders of Moore J, from which leave to appeal is now sought, determined matters of practice and procedure within the foregoing statements of principle, involving as they did the obligation of Ms Hemming to submit to cross-examination on affidavits made by her in early April of this year, and to file a separate affidavit disclosing the assets of Sharman Networks\", 'Those obligations were said to be no different in principle to any other interlocutory procedural order of the court, whether made pre-trial or during a trial, requiring parties to swear affidavits, to answer questions in cross-examination and to provide documentation', \"On the question of what constitutes 'substantial injustice' for the purposes of determining an application for leave to appeal, counsel for the Music companies placed particular reliance upon the decision of the Full Federal Court delivered earlier in the primary proceedings, which denied leave to appeal from a decision by Wilcox J refusing to set aside Anton Piller orders that his Honour had earlier made: Brilliant Digital Entertainment Pty Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (2004) 63 IPR 373\", 'I will refer further to that authority shortly', 'The Sharman applicants sought to emphasise the existence of practical burdens imposed by the orders made by Moore J on 17 November 2005, although in reality it was principally with respect to the order for cross-examination of Ms Hemming to which that assertion was directed', \"They maintained that the requirement to appear for cross-examination was not analogous to the 'routine steps' of swearing an affidavit during the normal course of a trial and entering the witness box to answer questions related to its contents\", \"Rather, the requirement to be cross-examined on an asset disclosure affidavit was said to be 'at the extreme end of the Court's armoury', by virtue of the fact that the making of an order for cross-examination on an affidavit of this kind is predicated upon the Court having implicitly found the deponent of that affidavit to be in contempt of court\", 'I was referred by the Sharman applicants to an earlier Full Federal Court decision in Minister for Immigration  Multicultural  Indigenous Affairs v Wong [2002] FCAFC 327 in support of their submission that since the present circumstances give rise to an important question of principle, leave to appeal should be readily granted', \"The parties' respective submissions concerning material matters bearing upon the justification or otherwise for the grant of orders ancillary to the Mareva relief and my incidental observations  10 The affidavit filed in support of the application for leave to appeal by Mr Rohan Higgins, the solicitor for the Sharman applicants, contained the following broad submission under the heading '[i]njustice if leave is refused':  'If leave to appeal is not granted then the orders of Moore J will operate and will have to be complied with\", 'Any subsequent challenge to those orders would then be futile and academic', 'The orders are interlocutory in form but final in the result in relation to the issues raised', \"' So much is correct as a general statement as to the consequences of his Honour's orders\", 'However, the nature and context of the application for leave here involved in practical terms an appeal, or virtually so, as will hereafter emerge', \"The Music companies contended that the Sharman applicants' submissions proceeded in reality 'on the erroneous basis that every interlocutory decision that requires a party to do an act will be automatically susceptible to leave to appeal and to being stayed'\", \"The Music companies' position was that the orders requiring Ms Hemming to file an affidavit disclosing the assets of Sharman Networks, and to attend for cross-examination on the affidavit she had earlier sworn as to disclosure of her assets, were merely procedural in nature and therefore, incapable as such of determining any final rights of the parties\", \"So much accorded with Moore J's understanding of the nature of those orders, as indicated in [30] of his Honour's reasons for judgment\", \"The primary submission made by the Music companies as to why leave to appeal ought not to be granted related to the failure of the Sharman applicants to adduce evidence demonstrative of the claim that they would suffer 'substantial injustice', should leave be refused\", \"The Music companies rejected any notion to the effect that the mere fact of Ms Hemming being compelled to swear an affidavit as to disclosure of Sharman Networks' assets, and to attend for cross-examination upon her own disclosure affidavits, without more, amounted to 'substantial injustice', in the sense that such expression has been used in numerous authorities concerned with the grant of leave to appeal\", \"Reference was made to Gerlach v Clifton Bricks Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 22 ; (2002) 209 CLR 478, in which Gaudron, McHugh and Hayne JJ, in a different context, considered that the bare proposition that an order mandating 'trial by judge alone, as opposed to trial by judge and jury, can amount, without more, to a substantial wrong to a party or to a miscarriage of justice, [was] a startling proposition'\", 'The reality of the dilemma in which the Court is placed by the present application is the need for consideration in some depth of the matters to which attention has been drawn by the Sharman applicants, before determining whether leave to appeal ought formally to be granted to appeal in the first place', \"The Sharman applicants relied upon a further passage from the majority's reasons for judgment in Gerlach at [13], as follows:  'The principles governing the grant of leave to appeal against interlocutory orders are well established...If it is plain that wrong principle was applied by the judge considering the application, it may well be that leave should be granted...'  13 The Music companies, for their part, placed particular reliance upon the joint reasons for judgment of Black CJ and Stone J in Brilliant Digital for the approach that they contended ought to be adopted in my consideration of the present application for leave to appeal\", \"In refusing leave to appeal from Wilcox J's decision to decline to set aside earlier Anton Piller orders that had been made in the course of the subject litigation, their Honours were said not to have considered at all the merits of the contemplated appeal there in issue\", \"The following passages appearing at [7]-[8] and [13]-[14] of their Honour's reasons for judgment in Brilliant Digital were asserted by the Music companies to be apposite to the present application:   '[7] In our view these matters [the matters contended by the applicants to amount to substantial injustice] would not, either individually or cumulatively, occasion injustice to the applicants of such a character and to such a degree as to justify the grant of leave\", 'While it is neither necessary nor appropriate to attempt to define the concept of substantial injustice some observations may be ventured', 'The flexibility of the principles governing the grant of leave to appeal indicates that the concept of substantial injustice must also be flexible', 'The requirement of leave to appeal indicates, however, that substantial injustice requires something more than that the subject decision is incorrect, otherwise the criterion would be superfluous', 'The qualification of \"injustice\" by \"substantial\" points to a detriment that, while not necessarily irreparable, is more than mere inconvenience or delay in the exercise of a right', \"[8] The distinction between interlocutory decisions concerning matters of practice and procedure and those that concern the substantive interests of the parties recognises both the greater likelihood of an incorrect decision as to a substantive right causing substantial injustice and the importance of preserving a judge's power to supervise the orderly preparation of a matter for trial\", 'In determining whether there has been substantial injustice it is appropriate for the court to take these factors into account', 'The need to keep a tight rein upon interference with orders at first instance that do not determine substantive rights has even more force today in the context of procedural reforms and active case management undertaken with a view to the early identification of the real issues between the parties and the expeditious and efficient resolution of them...   [13] The challenged orders were plainly directed to matters of practice and procedure and did not determine any substantive rights', 'They were directed to the capture and preservation of certain data and information and this purpose has now been effected', 'Importantly, the applicants for leave do not seek to reverse this by destruction of the material seized pursuant to the challenged orders', 'The primary judge has now made orders relating to the use of the material seized including its safekeeping by an independent party and, subject to appropriate confidentiality undertakings, the making of a safety or backup copy of the material', 'Orders have also been made granting preliminary access to the material for the purpose of any application that includes material not falling within the challenged orders', 'The music companies are to have only such access to the seized material as would be normally available on discovery', 'This shows that there is presently in train an orderly process for the management of the seized material in which the interests of both parties will receive due consideration', '[14] In these circumstances we are far from satisfied that substantial injustice would follow from refusing the application for leave to appeal and, on that basis, we would refuse leave to appeal', 'That being so we do not propose to comment on the correctness or otherwise of the decision of the primary judge', 'Nothing we have said should be taken as suggesting that the making of the challenged orders was not a serious matter requiring very careful consideration by the primary judge; plainly, whether or not the applicants are correct in their contention that his decision was erroneous, the application for the challenged orders and the subsequent application to set them aside did receive consideration of that character', \"'   (The emphasis appearing in [7] above in non-italics is mine)\", \"The Music companies contended that the orders made by Moore J were truly interlocutory in nature, rather than substantial in effect, being directed to 'the capture and preservation' of assets of the Sharman applicants pursuant to the Mareva relief granted\", 'They pointed out that Moore J had reached his decision to impose those orders after careful application of the relevant legal principles, with due consideration of the lengthy evidence put before him by both parties', 'Moreover, Moore J was said to have made it clear in [39] of his reasons for judgment that any cross-examination would be subject to the control of the Court, thereby limiting any prejudice that may be suffered by Ms Hemming or the other applicants', \"In those circumstances, counsel for the Music companies further contended that the applicants had failed to show that the obligations imposed upon them by Moore J amounted to anything greater than 'mere inconvenience'\", 'On that footing, the Music companies concluded that the Sharman applicants had failed to overcome the threshold requirement of establishing substantial injustice, and that leave to appeal should be refused on that basis alone', \"Acceptance of that proposition was said to have the consequence realistically that consideration of the draft grounds of appeal from Moore J's judgment as formulated by the Sharman applicants, would not be necessary\", 'There is considerable force in those submissions of the Music companies', 'The Sharman applicants submitted that Brilliant Digital was distinguishable from the present circumstances because in the former instance, the orders the subject of application for leave to appeal arose from an Anton Piller order that had already been executed, but in the present case, Ms Hemming was yet to be cross-examined and had not, as at the date of hearing of the application, sworn an affidavit for instance on behalf of Sharman Networks', \"I should interpolate to record that subsequent to reserving judgment on the question of leave to appeal, the Sharman applicants applied for a stay on Moore J's order requiring Ms Hemming to file that affidavit, and that I refused to grant that stay, but made orders requiring the affidavit to be left in a sealed envelope to be opened only upon further order of the Court\", \"Because a Full Court on appeal is in a position to intervene in relation to the subjection of Ms Hemming to Moore J's orders, and because those orders were made, on the Sharman applicants' case, erroneously by his Honour, it was contended by the Sharman applicants to be unjust if leave to appeal was not to be granted in relation to his Honour's orders\", \"The Sharman applicants further submitted that the Full Court 'regularly' grants leave to appeal where it can be shown that the exercise of a discretion has miscarried, and where that miscarriage in the exercise of a discretion involves an important question of principle, citing as authority Wong at [22]\", 'In Wong , the Full Federal Court held that the primary judge had failed to correctly apply the relevant legal test grounding the order made below', \"No mention was made by the Full Court of the need to establish 'substantial injustice' before a grant of leave to appeal is to be made\", \"Counsel for the Music companies submitted in response that Wong was of no assistance, since it was a decision made as a result of the primary judge having ordered the filing of interrogatories in the absence of evidence from the party sought to be interrogated going beyond a 'mere allegation'\", \"So much was said to stand in contrast with the considerable array of evidence provided respectively to Wilcox, Lindgren and Moore JJ at various interlocutory stages concerning Ms Hemming's control of the Sharman companies and a related and involved trust estate\", \"In any event the Music companies submitted that the Court's decision in Wong must be read subject to the later reasons of the Full Court in Brilliant Digital , which required inter alia that 'substantial injustice' be shown\", 'There is in my opinion clear force in those submissions of the Music companies', \"Contrary moreover to the Music companies' primary submissions, the Sharman applicants contended that should leave to appeal be refused, they would indeed suffer 'substantial injustice'\", 'That was said to be because the order to cross-examine a deponent of a disclosure affidavit was an exceptional one, and because Moore J had failed correctly to apply the relevant principles in making the order, in that his Honour had not made a positive finding that the affidavit disclosure by Ms Hemming of her own assets was inadequate', 'In my opinion however, the reasons of the primary judgment, which I have extracted in [5] above of these reasons are in substance to that effect, or at least sufficiently so', 'In any event, the making of an order requiring cross-examination on a disclosure affidavit was said by the Sharman applicants to be tantamount to a finding of contempt, or at least predicated upon such a finding', 'That latter contention would seem to be directed to an overstatement, in circumstances where the complaint was inadequate responses to the enforcement of orders made ancillary to Mareva relief', 'In support of those propositions of the Sharman applicants, I was taken to several authorities in the United Kingdom and Australia concerned with the making of orders for cross-examination on disclosure affidavits made in pursuit of compliance with a Mareva order', \"Thus in Den Norske Bank ASA v Antonatos [1999] QB 271, Waller LJ (with whom Chadwick and Millett LJJ agreed) said in a passage at 290, upon which the Sharman applicants placed reliance:  'It is finally important to recognise that it is only in exceptional circumstances that cross-examination will be ordered on an affidavit sworn pursuant to a Mareva order: see House of Spring Gardens Ltd v Waite [1985] FSR 173 at 181, per Slade LJ\", 'The anxieties expressed by Scott J in Bayer AG v Winter (No 2) [1986] 1 WLR 540 relating to the court wanting no part of a star chamber process must constantly be borne in mind...\\'  The passage from the reasons for judgment of Slade LJ in House of Spring Gardens, referred to by Waller LJ above, reads as follows:   \\'I can very well see that on the particular facts of many cases --- perhaps most cases --- the court might not consider it \"just and convenient\" to order the cross-examination of a defendant who has filed an affidavit in purported compliance with a Mareva order, in a case where the plaintiff has not yet seen fit to issue a motion for contempt and is not seeking an order for the swearing of a second affidavit by the defendant concerned...\\'  Whether there has occurred \\'purported compliance with a Mareva order\\' must surely be viewed in terms of substance as well as mere form', 'Lord Justice Slade made those remarks in the course of overruling the decision of Scott J at first instance, which decision had been to the effect that a court did not have the power under s 37 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 (UK) to make an order requiring cross-examination ancillary to compliance with a Mareva order, in the absence of circumstances whereby a justiciable issue is before the Court in respect of which the evidence of the deponent is relevant to the resolution thereof, for instance where the deponent of the disclosure affidavit was the subject of a contempt motion', \"The 'anxieties expressed by Scott J', and also referred to by Waller LJ in Den Norske Bank , appear in Scott J's earlier reasons for judgment in Bayer AG v Winter (No 2) [1986] 1 WLR 540\", 'In that latter case, Scott J was concerned with an application seeking orders that the defendant submit to cross-examination on a wide range of matters in aid of earlier Anton Piller and Mareva orders made by the Court', \"Scott J referred to the scope of the cross-examination contemplated at 543 as follows:   'Mr Prescott [for the plaintiff] made clear that the purpose of his proposed cross-examination of the first defendant is a free-ranging one\", 'He proposes to question him as to the whereabouts of his assets world-wide', 'He proposes to question him as to his knowledge of and part played in transactions in counterfeit Baygon wherever they may have happened', \"'  20 The primary proceedings in Bayer concerned allegations of an organised system for the sale of counterfeit Baygon insecticide products\", 'As at the time of the hearing before the presiding judge, no statement of claim had been filed', 'Moreover, no evidence proving the allegations of sale of counterfeit Baygon was placed before the presiding judge for the purposes of the application, and at no stage had the defendant had an opportunity to confront any such evidence', 'Counsel for the plaintiff had indicated to the presiding judge that pending receipt of certain answers in cross-examination, the plaintiffs were minded subsequently to pursue contempt proceedings against the defendant', \"It was in those somewhat extreme circumstances, well removed from the present context here presented that Scott J made the following emphatic statement (at 544) in the course of refusing the order sought for the cross-examination of the defendant, being dictum upon which the Sharman applicants placed reliance in the present context:  'Star Chamber interrogatory procedure has formed no part of the judicial process in this country for several centuries\", 'The proper function of a judge in civil litigation is to decide issues between parties', 'It is not, in my opinion, to preside over an interrogation', \"The police, charged with the upholding of the public law, cannot subject a citizen to cross-examination before a judge in order to discover the truth about the citizen's misdeeds\", 'How then, as a matter of discretion, can it be right in a civil case, in aid of rights which, however important, are merely private rights, to subject a citizen to such a cross-examination?', \"A fortiori it cannot be right to do so in a case where the plaintiff seeking the cross-examination of the defendant is holding itself free to use the defendant's answers for the purpose of an application to commit him to prison for contempt\", \"'  I would respectfully withhold from any such somewhat characterisation of the present conduct of the Music companies in their pursuit of what seems to me to be both reasonable and authentic means designed to ensure that Mareva relief is afforded adequate facilitation and implementation in the context of Music companies' intellectual property protection and preservation upheld by the primary judge in the principal litigation\", 'Senior counsel for the Sharman applicants asserted that nowhere in the reasons for judgment of Moore J is there a finding that the disclosures made by Mr Gee of the assets of the relevant two Sharman companies were incomplete, or that the disclosures by Ms Hemming in her affidavits as to her own assets were incomplete', \"I would first observe that any finding of Moore J on the completeness, or otherwise, of Mr Gee's disclosure affidavits could not possibly have any bearing upon the appropriateness of his Honour's order requiring Ms Hemming to attend for cross-examination on her own affidavits, and any suggestion to the contrary is in my opinion incorrect\", \"Moreover, any such conclusion begs the question as to the operation of the notion of 'incomplete', and the context in which it is used\", \"The theme of the primary judge's concern was more in the nature of inadequacy and lack of clarity\", \"Senior counsel for the Sharman applicants asserted that the Music companies had not demonstrated that Ms Hemming's assets included what he termed 'the beneficial interest in the Sharman companies' or that the 'loan transaction with TIL was a sham'\", 'A present concern of the Music companies is indeed with the beneficial ownership of funds', 'In the case of tangible and intangible assets subjected to the interposition of a complexity of offshore established companies and trust estates purportedly controlled by an offshore trustee corporation, the task of gaining access to and control of those assets, in order to enforce onshore court judgments and orders, can be an expensive and formidable undertaking for a successful litigant', \"It was in the light of the complexity and opacity concerning Ms Hemming's apparent employment of a Vanuatu trust instrument that the primary judge observed for the time being as follows at [36]:  '... it is, in my opinion unnecessary for me to resolve some specific issues concerning that structure which were the subject of argument\", 'One was whether [Ms Hemming] has a beneficial interest in the Sharman trust or at least has an interest which should have been identified in her disclosure affidavit', \"'  22 Senior counsel for the Sharman applicants submitted that having failed to make a finding on this point, the primary judge appeared to have concluded that the power to order cross-examination should be exercised in order to allow the matter of any such beneficial ownership to be further explored, his Honour observing in that context at [36]:  'If this issue [was] explored in cross-examination then the Court will be left with a greater measure of certainty about whether she does [have an interest in the Sharman companies per medium of the Sharman trust]\", \"'  23 In further response to the primary judge's endeavours to distil an expedient means for the ascertainment relevantly of beneficial ownership, it was contended by the Sharman applicants that in circumstances such as the present, an order for cross-examination of a deponent 'cannot be made unless the Court is affirmatively satisfied that there has been a non-disclosure', all that being said to have involved 'a resolution of the arguments expressly eschewed by Moore J in [36] [of his reasons]'\", 'I have difficulty with that contention', \"In the context of his Honour's review of some of the offshore as well as onshore transactions, his Honour had made the significant finding, along the way as it were, that the 'evidence ... suggest[s] a loan was made after the property was purchased...' and also that 'a loan was not secured by a mortgage'\", \"Consequently his Honour was able to observe at [37] that '... real doubts arise about, and uncertainty surrounds, the reason why this transaction took place when it did, and whether the moneys transferred to TIL were, in truth, in satisfaction of a loan or continues to constitute an asset of, and requires disclosure by, [Ms Hemming]\", \"' In the circumstances I have thus far recorded, that was an apposite observation\", 'All that was referrable of course to the implications of the payment of $1,116,405.63 by Ms Hemming to TIL, following the sale of her Sydney residence on 4 February 2005; that payment appears to have been made out of the proceeds of a sale of that residence, which was effected for the gross price of $2,100,000 to a person identified by the evidence as an accountant of certain of the Sharman companies', 'There was no sufficiently detailed or otherwise cogent evidence as to who exercised the substantial or underlying control of decision making of TIL, or as to the basis of or reasons for such alleged indebtedness having crystallised in the first place', \"The state of the evidence as to the control of TIL was itself the subject of disputation before Moore J and senior counsel for the Sharman applicants sought to attribute error to his Honour's judgment for the further reason that he had failed to make a finding as to Ms Hemming's control, or otherwise, of that entity\", 'The Sharman applicants postulated that the \\'remark\\' made by Lindgren J at [13] of his Honour\\'s reasons for judgment in Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 that \\'[Wilcox J] accepted [in the course of granting the Mareva relief on 22 March 2005] that the Sharman Companies were controlled by Ms Hemming by reason of a \"client services agreement\" between her and TIL dated 8 April 2002\\' was an \\'unsure foundation for any finding of control of the Sharman trust or the Sharman companies [by Ms Hemming]\\', and was thus inappropriately or impermissibly relied upon by Moore J in formulating his reasons for judgment', \"That submission lacked merit, particularly in the light of [31] of Lindgren J's reasons for judgment in which his Honour paraphrased the two-fold acceptance, given in cross-examination by the solicitor acting for Sharman License and Sharman Networks in their application before Lindgren J, that TIL as trustee of the Sharman trust was the ultimate beneficial owner of all the shares issued in Sharman License and Sharman Networks, and moreover that Wilcox J had himself appeared to accept that in consequence of the client services agreement, Ms Hemming 'controlled the Sharman trust'\", 'The Music companies had submitted to Moore J that given the evidentiary shortcomings on a subject readily susceptible to documentary demonstration, inclusive of banking records I might add, there was in truth and reality no antecedent loan, that the transfer of those funds by Ms Hemming to TIL in Vanuatu constituted a sham transaction, and consequently that those monies remained her own property beneficially, and should have been identified and disclosed as such in her affidavit provided in the Mareva context', 'Once more, so it was asserted by the Sharman applicants, his Honour declined to make any concluded finding on the subject', \"The point is however that his Honour had been able to infer from the surrounding circumstances I have already outlined that there was some force in the Music companies' submission\", 'But in any event his Honour was of the view that he could permit cross-examination of Ms Hemming on and in relation to those matters because at least doubt existed in relation to that area of enquiry', \"In respect of that finding, the Sharman applicants referred to Moore J's rationale expressed at [37] of his reasons for judgment and emphasised it as is indicated in non-italics:  'Greater clarity about this matter [being the transfer of funds to TIL on 4 February 2005] may arise from the cross-examination of [Ms Hemming]\", \"'  From what I have already reviewed, there was ample justification for his Honour to have reached that view of the unusual transactional offshore circumstances in evidence before him\", \"It was submitted however on behalf of the Sharman applicants that so much did not imply that Moore J was satisfied that there had not been compliance with the order of the court to disclose assets by Ms Hemming, which affirmative finding was of course contended by the Sharman applicants to be a prerequisite to the making of an order for cross-examination; I was referred for comparison to Planet International v Garcia (No 2) (1991) 1 Qd R 426, where the following appears at 427 of Thomas J's reasons for judgment:    'In the present case I am satisfied Mr Garcia has not adequately complied with the order of the Court\", \"On the material before me, he has provided a collection of some untruthful statements, non-disclosures and qualifications...'  I was also referred, by way of further comparison, to the following observations of the Court of Appeal in England in Motorola Credit Corporation v Uzan (No 2) [2003] EWCA Civ 752 ; [2004] 1 WLR 113 at [147] :   'The piecemeal, late, untruthful and manifestly incomplete disclosure which the defendants gave amply justified the view that cross-examination was just and convenient because it might reveal assets which would make the freezing order more effective\", \"'  But of course those respective findings related to differing matters and circumstances, and neither finding was intended to be definitively exemplary, such as to exclude the need for further exploration\", \"My reading of his Honour's reasons here was that he was far from satisfied with the nature or extent of the purported offshore structures and transactions to the extent apparent from the evidence, involving as they did the creation of a trust estate somewhat cognate to what have often been described as 'blind trusts'\", 'Concerns of that nature appear to have persuaded or assisted to persuade the primary judge of the need to order that Ms Hemming submit to cross-examination on her disclosure affidavits', 'In determining to take that approach, his Honour paid regard to the relevant authorities dealing with both the grant of Mareva relief, and the making of orders ancillary to the same, including orders requiring the swearing of disclosure affidavits and cross-examination on those affidavits', \"After reviewing the relevant principles enunciated in those authorities, his Honour concluded at [28]:   '...ultimately the cautionary words of the four members of the High Court in [ Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380 at 403-404] set out at [18] above must be heeded\", \"Orders made in the Court's ancillary jurisdiction must be founded on a doctrinal and principled basis\", \"A Mareva order is protective of the Court's processes, including the efficacy of execution of those orders\", 'Orders concerning disclosure affidavits and cross examination can, in turn, be made to render the Mareva order more efficacious', 'This is the touchstone for determining whether leave should be given to cross examine', 'A relevant consideration in determining whether leave should be given might, in an appropriate case, be the failure of the deponent of a disclosure affidavit to disclose assets completely or promptly or both', 'In such a case, leave might be given because doubts might arise about whether the deponent had understood and accepted the obligations and burdens imposed by the Mareva order and the ancillary order requiring the disclosure affidavit', 'Cross examination might be appropriate to test whether the disclosure affidavits fully revealed all assets on which the Mareva order operated and which might be available to satisfy any judgment', 'However, in other cases, other more significant factors might support the granting of leave to cross examine', \"'  The 'cautionary words' of the High Court in Cardile earlier extracted by his Honour at [18] of his reasons below referred to the need for courts to exercise caution in making Mareva orders and to only do so upon a principled basis, having regard to the impact that those orders may have on respondents and third parties\", 'It was submitted nevertheless on behalf of the Sharman applicants that the premise upon which the application for an order for cross-examination order proceeded here was that Ms Hemming had breached the order requiring her to disclose her assets, and that the basis upon which the Music companies litigated the proceedings below was to seek to convince the primary judge that there had occurred inadequate disclosure, on the footing that Ms Hemming did have a substantial asset, namely beneficial interests in the Sharman companies, and further that the loan transaction with TIL was in truth a sham arrangement', \"Those issues were to have been debated before his Honour at length below 'but were never resolved'\", 'Certainly the premise upon which the order is sought, as I have already sought to explain, was an inadequacy of disclosure of such matters in circumstances that indicated the need for further exploration and inquiry', \"It was next asserted by the Sharman applicants that the high point of his Honour's conclusion below, both as to the so-called 'putative ownership by Ms Hemming of the Sharman Trust' and as to 'the existence or otherwise of the loan made by TIL to Ms Hemming repaid in February 2005', was that there was 'a lack of clarity' about the matter\", 'My observation is however, that any such lack of clarity about the alleged loan and its repayment or partial repayment derives from its inherently commercially, inexplicable origins and purposes in the first place', 'It was submitted therefore to be an unprincipled exercise of discretion for his Honour to have ordered cross-examination in circumstances where the Music companies had not convinced his Honour upon either of those conditions which they had raised', 'In truth, so the submissions continued, his Honour fell into the error of making an order for cross-examination in circumstances where no basis had been demonstrated to the Court to make such an order', \"For reasons I have already ventured, the concerns relevantly expressed by his Honour were more than some mere 'lack of clarity'\", \"In conclusion therefore, it was the case of the Sharman applicants that Moore J failed correctly to apply the relevant legal principles in committing Ms Hemming to cross-examination on her disclosure affidavit, and that it must follow that the Sharman applicants would inherently suffer 'substantial injustice' if Ms Hemming be so required to submit to cross-examination in accordance with the relief granted by the primary judge\", \"In short, the complaint was that Moore J gave leave for the cross-examination to take place because the Court might 'be left with a greater measure of certainty' [36], and further 'because cross-examination may lead to greater clarity' [37], and that so much exemplified errors in principle in the exercise of his discretion\", 'Conclusions upon the principal matters raised  31 In my opinion, and for the reasons I have largely foreshadowed in my observations upon the submissions already recorded, the application for leave to appeal brought by the Sharman applicants has not sufficient cogency to justify the grant of any such leave', \"The case of the Music companies presented to the primary judge (Moore J) for relief of the nature and to the extent granted was sufficiently in line with established principle as to be clear from 'sufficient doubt'\", \"I do not think that the United Kingdom and Australian authorities establish inflexible requirements to the extent postulated by the Sharman applicants, in particular concerning the Court's jurisdiction to grant leave to cross-examine the deponents of disclosure affidavits in Mareva contexts\", \"His Honour's approach in particular to the issue of granting leave to the Music companies to cross-examine Ms Hemming was soundly justified in the light of the evidentiary circumstances concerning the Sharman applicants' offshore trust structure, and the circumstances of and context in which such a substantial sum of money was transferred to an offshore company in the amount and in the context that occurred\", 'It is readily apparent that the primary judge placed significant weight, and I think rightly so, upon the following findings made by Lindgren J in the context of the preceding interlocutory proceedings of Sharman License Holdings Ltd v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 802 , being proceedings which I have referred to earlier', 'At [15] of his reasons for judgment, Lindgren J observed as follows:  \\'As noted earlier, the Sharman Companies were ultimately beneficially owned by TIL as trustee of the Sharman Trust, and, notwithstanding the reference to \"discretion\" and the right of termination, the client services agreement provided evidence before his Honour that TIL, including TIL as trustee of the Sharman Trust, was likely to act at the direction of Ms Hemming', 'Since TIL, as trustee of the Sharman Trust was the ultimate beneficial owner of all the issued shares in the Sharman Companies, there was evidence before his Honour to show that they were also likely to act at her direction', \"'  Earlier, at [4], his Honour had observed:   'On 4 February 2005, Ms Hemming and Richard Kilmer-Barber settled a sale of their home at Castle Cove in Sydney to John Simon Myers for $2,100,000\", 'Title was transferred on 16 February 2005', 'Ms Hemming and Dr Kilmer-Barber continued to occupy the property', \"Ms Hemming's interest in the home was apparently her only substantial asset within the jurisdiction\", 'There was evidence before his Honour that Mr Myers occupied some role such as accountant or bookkeeper of the Sharman Companies', 'Ms Hemming was the Chief Executive Officer of the Sharman Companies', 'Out of the proceeds of sale, $1,116,405.63 was transferred to a bank account in Vanuatu... which is where the Sharman Companies are incorporated', \"'  33 After reviewing in some detail the Australian authorities relating to misuse or abuse of process and of Mareva orders, and also the evidence placed before him in the present segment of the proceedings, in particular that concerned with Ms Hemming's apparent control of Sharman Networks, and Wilcox J's conclusions thereon, Moore J expressed his satisfaction that Ms Hemming should be required to swear a disclosure affidavit in relation to Sharman Network's assets, largely for the reasons I have already canvassed and which I will reproduce below, the same having been the focus of much of the respective parties submissions made in the present interlocutory proceedings (at [36] and [37]):  'This leads to a consideration of whether [Ms Hemming] should be cross examined on her affidavits concerning disclosure of her assets\", 'In my opinion, such an order should be made', 'The evidence points clearly to the structure reflected in the Sharman trust and the arrangements in Vanuatu more generally, having been established by [Ms Hemming]', 'Counsel for the applicants described that structure as opaque', 'This is in an apt description', 'However, it is, in my opinion, unnecessary for me to resolve some specific issues concerning that structure which were the subject of argument', 'One was whether the fourth respondent has a beneficial interest in the Sharman trust or at least has an interest which should have been identified in her disclosure affidavit', 'Not only is the evidence on this issue likely to be incomplete ([Ms Hemming] has proffered no evidence and almost certainly the applicants do not have all relevant records - they do not even have the trust deed) but it is also by no means clear to me how the law of Vanuatu would operate on the arrangements revealed, to this point, by the evidence', 'It would be unsatisfactory, dealing with the type of issues presently under consideration, to proceed on the basis that the law in that country can be presumed to be the same as the law of Australia: see The Parchim [1918] AC 157 at 161', 'The findings of Wilcox J... point towards a conclusion that she does have such an interest', 'If this issue is explored in cross examination then the Court will be left with a greater measure of certainty about whether she does', 'The transfer of the property by [Ms Hemming] to another... has several unusual features', 'It occurred at a time when final submissions were being made in the primary proceedings', \"Registration of the transfer occurred five days after the applicant's final submissions were served on the respondents\", 'One can infer that the strengths and weaknesses of the respective cases would have been apparent to the parties and those advising them', 'The transferee was to a person associated with [Ms Hemming]', 'He was an accountant who had work [sic] for the Sharman companies', 'A significant part of the proceeds of the sale were paid to [TIL]', 'This was in settlement of what was said to be a loan', 'While some of the documents in evidence can be viewed as supporting the existence of a loan, they nonetheless suggest a loan was made after the property was purchased', 'That, itself, is unusual, though one must accept there may be an explanation for this including, as counsel for [Ms Hemming] pointed out, that the funds lent replaced bridging finance', 'But the evidence suggests that a loan was not secured by a mortgage', 'In all, real doubts arise about, and uncertainty surrounds, the reason why this transaction took place when it did and whether the moneys transferred to TIL were, in truth, in satisfaction of a loan or continues to constitute an asset of, and requires disclosure by, [Ms Hemming]', 'Greater clarity about this matter may arise from the cross examination of [Ms Hemming]', \"'  34 With respect to the carefully as well as forcefully presented submissions made to the Court by senior counsel for the Sharman applicants, I am unable to distil material or significant error in the approach of the primary judge\", \"It was readily to be inferred by the primary judge, from the material placed before his Honour, that Ms Hemming did exercise what his Honour described as a central role in relation to the business of Sharman Networks, and moreover that Mr Gee, who was put forward by the Sharman applicants as having performed that role, was '... only in form an appropriate person' to have provided the principal affidavit evidence on behalf of the Sharman companies\", 'I have not found the observations appearing in the English authorities, to which I have been referred by the Sharman applicants, and which I have extracted, to be of assistance, at least in contextual circumstances such as here involved, where the Sharman applicants have resorted to offshore transactions bearing no evident commercial significance, at least of transparency, and did so, in part, co-incidentally upon the unsuccessful involvement of the Sharman parties and their entities in the very substantial Universal Music litigation which concluded on the question of liability on 5 September 2005', \"At least in circumstances such as those, the description 'Star Chamber interrogatory procedures' is inapposite\", \"Moreover in line with the observations made in Brilliant Digital , the orders here complained of are in substance at least presently concerned with 'matters of practice and procedure', and not 'substantive interests of the parties'\", \"Largely upon the footing of the foregoing findings, and his Honour's further findings as to the Sharman companies' principal deponent of affidavit evidence (being Mr Gee) having been '... only in form an appropriate person', though not in substance, and instead his having been essentially 'a cipher', I am unable to accept otherwise than that the primary judge was correct in his view that '[i]t is not possible to be affirmatively satisfied that [the disclosure]... is now complete', and further, in pointing out that Mr Myers' testimony did '... not provide sufficient assurance that Mr Gee's affidavits can, on their face, be accepted as constituting a full disclosure'\", \"In the light of my preceding discussion and analysis I also think that his Honour was right to have concluded in the following terms at [39] in the course of rejecting the Sharman applicants' contention that the subjection of Ms Hemming to cross-examination amounted to an abuse of the Court's process:  'I accept that the [Music companies] would wish to ascertain who are the real and effective controllers of the Sharman companies\", 'I also accept that this may become a matter about which questions might be asked if the orders sought by the applicants are made', 'However if that becomes a legitimate area of cross examination (bearing in mind that any cross examination will be subject to the control of the Court) it will be for a legitimate purpose and not an illegitimate and collateral one', 'I do not accept the criticisms of the way the [Music companies] identified and characterised the breaches of the disclosure order', 'In particular, [Sharman License and Sharman Networks] elected to provide the disclosure affidavits required of them from a person appropriate in form but not in substance', 'The [Music companies], who necessarily cannot be certain from their own knowledge of the matters to which the disclosure affidavits related, were entitled to review critically the affidavits proffered by [those Sharman companies]', 'All the more so given the opaque structure reflected in the Sharman trust and the arrangements in Vanuatu more generally and referred to above', 'While some of the criticisms were not significant, they included the failure to disclose significant sums held by lawyers on trust', 'I am not satisfied that the application should be dismissed for the reasons advanced by the [Sharman applicants]', \"'  37 In making order 3 on 17 November 2005, it was submitted that Moore J also fell into error\", \"The effect of order 3 was said to extend the 'freezing order' to the assets of Sharman Licence, which was erroneous because his Honour had overlooked the implications of the circumstance that Wilcox J had found in the main proceedings that such company had been completely successful and the claims made against it had been wholly dismissed\", \"Thus at [40], his Honour held as follows:  'In view of (Wilcox J's) conclusions concerning the liability of [Sharman License], no such order should be made concerning that company\", \"'  It was apparently common ground moreover that Sharman Licence was a wholly owned subsidiary of Sharman Networks\", 'So much was said by the Sharman parties to have been \\'entirely overlooked\\' when his Honour concluded at [40] of his reasons as follows:   \\'... the proposed order is intended to bind existing respondents and prohibiting them from \"causing or permitting any wholly-owned subsidiary\" from dealing with its assets subject to the exceptions in the order as originally formulated', 'This appears to me to be an appropriate extension of the original Mareva order and will ensure that assets of the respondents held, indirectly, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, will be controlled in the same way and for the same purpose as assets directly held to which the Mareva order presently applies', \"'  I am unable however to comprehend why Sharman License's subsidiary status in relation to Sharman Networks should exclude it from the operation of the order of the Court below, which understandably was so framed as to extend to 'any wholly owned subsidiary\", \"' As pointed out by the Music companies, such an order does not have the effect of extending the Mareva order to Sharman License's assets, per se , but rather, the order prevents 'Sharman Networks from causing its subsidiaries to dispose of their assets'\", 'In the result, I am of the opinion that the application of the Sharman parties for leave to appeal addressed in these reasons must be dismissed with costs', 'I certify

       "[['This is an application under s 1335 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) for orders that the applicant, Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd (Cosdean) provide security for costs to the respondent Football Federation Australia Limited (FFA) in the sum of $61,640 or such other amount as the Court deems appropriate',\n",
       "  'Section 1335(1) reads:   a corporation is plaintiff in any action or other legal proceeding, the court having jurisdiction in the matter may, if it appears by credible testimony that there is reason to believe that the corporation will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if successful in his, her or its defence, require sufficient security to be given for those costs and stay all proceedings until the security is given',\n",
       "  \"'   The principles upon which such an application must be determined are clear cut\",\n",
       "  'It is first necessary for FFA (the applicant on the motion) to establish that Cosdean will be unable to pay its costs if Cosdean is unsuccessful in the action',\n",
       "  'There must be a proper and real basis for believing that the applicant will be unable to meet an order for costs against it: Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson (1992) 7 ACSR 203 at 205',\n",
       "  'If that threshold test is met, the Court has an unfettered discretion as to whether, in all the circumstances, it should make the order which is sought: see Reinsurance Australia Corporation Limited v HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd (in liq) [2003] FCA 803 at [66] - [67]',\n",
       "  'In my view the threshold test has been satisfied',\n",
       "  'Cosdean is a small one-shareholder company',\n",
       "  'As at 30 June 2005 it had no net assets and in the financial year to that period, had traded at a loss',\n",
       "  'Its balance sheet at 30 June 2006 is not presently available',\n",
       "  'I do not say that by way of criticism as it is only a short period since the end of the financial year',\n",
       "  'Its draft profit and loss statement and trading statement show that it has a gross trading profit of $153,900 and an operating profit, before tax, of $38,400',\n",
       "  'Other information before the Court indicates that during the financial year to 30 June 2006, Cosdean received a substantial injection of funds in the order of $288,000 from what is called Sarjem Family Trust',\n",
       "  'There is no evidence to indicate that Sarjem Family Trust is a trust of one or other of the directors, although that might be suspected',\n",
       "  'In any event, that sum advanced during the course of the last financial year now represents a significant liability of Cosdean',\n",
       "  'There is no evidence to suggest that it is other than a current liability and there is no proposal (if in fact it is a liability to a family trust representing the directors or one or other of them) that the directors are prepared to subordinate that liability to the liability, if any, which is incurred by way of costs to FFA in this proceeding',\n",
       "  'I note also that the trading statement producing a gross profit of $153,900 includes purchases of roughly $212,000, sales of $144,000 and closing stock of some $222,000 which is noted to be closing stock at market value',\n",
       "  \"I infer from other evidence that those trading figures represent trading in the items which are the subject of the present claim, that is, what are called 'the products' in paragraph 11 of the amended statement of claim filed on 27 June 2006\",\n",
       "  'Given the lapse of time since the World Cup, in the absence of evidence it is not necessarily clear that the closing stock, that is World Cup products, will now be realisable at their market value',\n",
       "  'Otherwise, the position appears to be that the assets of the company, other than its stock in hand, represent cash of some $45,000 to $65,000 (the recent affidavit of Ms Watson, a director of Cosdean, suggests that the money in the bank account has reduced somewhat in the normal course of operations) and a loan account owed by Dean Cosenza of some $56,000',\n",
       "  'There is no evidence as to its recoverability',\n",
       "  'The liabilities, including the $288,000 and putting aside the liability to Deumer, are in the order of $380,000',\n",
       "  'There are no real estate assets or, so far as the evidence before me goes, other assets',\n",
       "  'In those circumstances, in my view, FFA has satisfied the threshold test imposed by s 1335 of the Corporations Act',\n",
       "  'As I noted, the discretion of the Court is then unrestricted',\n",
       "  'A number of matters have been put by counsel for the parties as to why the discretion should be exercised in one way or the other',\n",
       "  'Although it seems plain that someone sought to inhibit various football clubs from facilitating the marketing of the products by Cosdean in the critical period, it is not so clear that that inhibition emanated from or was engaged in by FFA',\n",
       "  'Counsel for FFA has also identified, by reference to the defence and the licensing agreements referred to, that there are some potential breaks in the line of authorisation which Cosdean may ultimately have to prove if it is to succeed in the proceedings',\n",
       "  'I do not presume to form a view as to the prospects of those defences succeeding, but it is plain enough, as I have said, that someone inhibited Cosdean from marketing the products through football clubs within Australia at a critical time',\n",
       "  'To that extent I think Cosdean has good prospects of succeeding but that does not indicate, in my view, that it necessarily has good prospects of succeeding against this respondent',\n",
       "  \"When referring to the 'good prospects' of Cosdean succeeding, I am assuming in its favour, although it is contentious, that it did have the authorisation to distribute the products which it claims\",\n",
       "  'I have taken those matters into account',\n",
       "  'I have also taken into account that there is no evidence that an order for security for costs would stultify the action',\n",
       "  \"There is also nothing to indicate that the directors of Cosdean, or those who stand behind Cosdean and who may ultimately benefit from the successful proceedings if it succeeds, are prepared to support the company by providing some security for costs or providing some undertaking to meet the costs of FFA if FFA's defence is successful\",\n",
       "  'I have also taken into account that at present there is no substantive evidence to indicate what the outcome would be for Cosdean if it were to succeed in this action',\n",
       "  'There is some evidence to indicate that, whoever was responsible for stultifying or impairing its capacity to sell the product at critical times, Cosdean was thereby restricted in a significant way from selling the product',\n",
       "  'Senior counsel for Cosdean contended that I should infer that but for that conduct not only would the sales anticipated in the trading statement have been realised but there would have been considerable further sales available to the applicant at critical times',\n",
       "  'That may well be the case',\n",
       "  'No doubt that is the case which will be advanced at the hearing but it is presently speculative on the material before me to determine that fact',\n",
       "  \"It is, in my view, simply in the realm of general speculation at present to conclude that, but for the conduct of FFA (or the conduct of whoever was responsible for impairing the sale of the products at the relevant time), Cosdean's financial position would have been dramatically better than it presently is\",\n",
       "  'The purchase of further product from Deumer would have incurred further expense and there is at present no information to indicate the availability of further funds to Cosdean to meet that expense, or to indicate clearly that it could have met that expense from its trading income from time to time',\n",
       "  'Even assuming that its present financial position, as reflected in the material now before me, as at 30 June 2006 is the consequence of the impugned conduct as asserted in the statement of claim, I do not think it is shown with any degree of satisfaction what its position would be but for that impugned conduct so as to satisfy me that its present circumstances are a consequence of that impugned conduct',\n",
       "  'Although senior counsel for Cosdean also contended that I should have regard to the public interest in the exercise of my discretion, and I do so in a general way, I do not see that there are particular features of the public interest which should influence the exercise of my discretion in any meaningful way in this matter',\n",
       "  'It is, after all, simply a dispute between commercial entities',\n",
       "  'In those circumstances, on balance, I have reached the view that it is appropriate to make an order for security for costs',\n",
       "  'FFA seeks an order for security for costs of $61,640',\n",

       "  'The first was that notwithstanding the payment of $10,000.00 by Ms Townsend (or those assisting her) having regard to the letters of 25 November 2003 (see [33], [34] and [35]), 27 November 2003 [36], 28 November 2003 [37] and 10 February 2004 [41], a further amount as at 10 February 2004 of $2,300.00 would be required to meet the cost of work undertaken from 13 December 2003 to that date and the additional tasks necessary to finalise the administration',\n",
       "  'The second consideration involved the question of whether further costs would be incurred by the trustee in responding to complaints and allegations and a threatened private prosecution or other proceedings',\n",
       "  'As to the first reason, the trustee on 10 February 2004 said that remuneration for work done from 13 December 2003 (having regard to the fact that the report to creditors was dated 12 December 2003 and the completion of the earlier billing period was 11 December 2003) was approximately $1,300.00 (plus GST), plus $580.00 for expenses (plus GST); that is, approximately $2,068.00',\n",
       "  'The trustee suggested a further amount of $2,200.00 would fairly represent the value of that work',\n",

       "  \"The trustee said in the letter of 10 February 2004 that he held $1,100.90 (being the $10,000.00 received, less remuneration of $8,099.10 and less the 8% ITSA realisation fee of $800.00) and upon receipt of a further $2,300.00 (including GST, the Government charges on re-transmitting Ms Townsend's land and the 8% ITSA charge) the trustee 'could draw down all or the major part of the cost to complete, prepare or lodge any land transfer forms and issue an annulment certificate under s 153A of the Bankruptcy Act )'\",\n",
       "  'In other words, a total amount of $3,400.90 would complete the administration, satisfy all relevant costs, charges, expenses and remuneration and result in an annulment certificate',\n",

       "  'However, Ms Townsend was plainly of the view that the request for the further monies was both unnecessary and unreasonable and accordingly she sought to test, in effect, the request by placing the matter before the court framed by the orders sought in the application',\n",

       "  'Those conclusions cannot stand in the face of the evidence for a number of reasons',\n",

       "  'Had those monies been paid, a s 153A certificate would have duly issued effecting an annulment',\n",
       "  \"Secondly, although the response of the trustee to the allegations of complaint might be regarded as robust, the trustee was nevertheless entitled to respond to complaints which he perceived to be misconceived and unmeritorious either because the assessment by the bankrupt of the reasonableness of proposed fees was not founded upon any proper basis or because allegations of abuses were not, in the trustee's view, correct (see Bellin v Pattison (Trustee) [1999] FCA 51 at [18] to [22])\",\n",

       "  \"Although the precise character of an 'act, omission or decision of the trustee' is not clear, s 178(1) may well be sufficiently broad in its formulation to confer power upon the court to make such order as the court thinks just and equitable in relation to the request by the trustee for the provision of further monies in respect of costs (both expenses and remuneration) incurred from 13 December 2003 to 10 February 2004 and in respect of those costs to be incurred in undertaking steps necessary to complete the administration\",\n",

       "  'In deciding whether to exercise her discretion her Honour considered: • A potential counter-claim, set-off or cross-demand of the appellant related to the original litigation between the parties, but which her Honour considered continued to suffer from all the deficits identified by Cooper J in Worchild v The Drink Nightclub (Qld) Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 642',\n",

       "  'Her Honour considered that the appellant had committed an act of bankruptcy, and that this was not a proper matter to be taken into account when exercising her discretion under s 52(2)',\n",

       "  'He says that par 4 of the Petition fails to state the date of the act of bankruptcy',\n",
       "  \"' (at [69])   Her Honour was satisfied that the creditors' petition was overall compliant and in all respects clear and unequivocal, that the appellant's submissions concerning the reference to 'creditor' and 'creditors' was a spurious argument without merit, and that par 4 was compliant with the formal requirements of the prescribed Form\",\n",
       "  \"Accordingly, there was nothing in the submissions made or on the evidence produced which would lead her Honour to find that there were defects in the bankruptcy notice or the creditor's petition sufficient to dismiss the petition, nor to exercise her discretion in favour of the appellant under s 52(2)(b) Bankruptcy Act\",\n",

       "  \"On 8 September 2005, a registrar of the Federal Court made orders extending the time for compliance with that notice pursuant to s 41(6A) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) ('the Act')\",\n",
       "  'The genesis of the protracted disputations that have taken place between Mr Pacer and Star Kitchens was the retention by Mr Pacer of Star Kitchens in 1999 for the purpose of the delivery and installation of several kitchens into a property development project being undertaken in Drummoyne in the State of New South Wales, in relation to which project he appears to have been a contractor',\n",
       "  'On 13 August 2002, Star Kitchens initiated proceedings against Mr Pacer in the Local Court of Sutherland in the State of New South Wales (proceedings no',\n",
       "  'of 2002) for liquidated sums for work done and materials provided by Star Kitchens to Mr Pacer in connection with that aspect of the Drummoyne development, for which Star Kitchens had not yet been paid',\n",
       "  'On 7 October 2003, Mr Pacer filed a notice of motion seeking leave to file a cross-claim against Star Kitchens',\n",
       "  'That application for leave was apparently refused by the Local Court on 23 October 2003',\n",
       "  'The final hearing of the Local Court proceedings subsequently took place on 27 October and 5 December 2003',\n",
       "  \"The tenor of Mr Pacer's amended defence to Star Kitchen's claim in the Local Court was that he had never personally entered into any contract with Star Kitchens for the provision of work or materials\",\n",
       "  \"It was Mr Pacer's contention that he was employed by a since deregistered company Freeport Morgan  Associates Pty Ltd ('FMA'), whereby he provided project management services to FMA in respect of the Drummoyne development, inferentially a company under his control, whether de facto or de jure\",\n",
       "  'Mr Pacer claimed that it was FMA that had entered into a contract with Star Kitchens in relation to the delivery and installation of kitchens into the Drummoyne development',\n",
       "  \"The cross-claim which Mr Pacer sought to file in the Local Court pleaded that Mr Pacer had lost fees and bonuses under his project management agreement with FMA, and further that he had incurred out-of-pocket costs because he was required to fund the rectification work necessitated by defects in Star Kitchen's work\",\n",
       "  'The loss of those fees and bonuses was further alleged to have arisen because Star Kitchens had failed to comply with their delivery and installation obligations within the times specified by their agreement with FMA',\n",
       "  \"On 8 April 2004 Magistrate Elms upheld Star Kitchen's claim against Mr Pacer ('the Local Court judgment')\",\n",
       "  \"In the course of his reasons for judgment, the Magistrate made the following findings concerning the relationship between Mr Pacer and FMA:  'The defendant [Mr Pacer] provided not one shred of evidence to corroborate any alleged project manager relationship with the company Freeport-Morgan  Associates Pty Ltd, and the evidence is all to the contrary that there was in fact any such relationship...   Contrary to his [Mr Pacer's] assertions, I have no doubt that the plaintiff [Star Kitchens] at all times knew the identity of the correct defendant, and that was Mr Pacer himself\",\n",
       "  \"I am unable to accept the defendant as a witness of truth...'  5 On 7 May 2004, Mr Pacer filed a summons in the Supreme Court of New South Wales seeking leave to appeal against that Local Court judgment (proceedings No\",\n",
       "  'of 2004)',\n",
       "  'On 12 November 2004, Mr Pacer commenced proceedings no',\n",
       "  'of 2004 against Star Kitchens in the Downing Centre Local Court',\n",
       "  \"In those proceedings Mr Pacer sought liquidated damages from Star Kitchens on grounds similar to those foreshadowed in his earlier cross-claim, which he had been unable to file owing to the Magistrate's decision to refuse the grant of leave\",\n",
       "  \"I will discuss those further Local Court proceedings in more detail shortly, since their existence bears significantly upon the issues arising in Mr Pacer's application to set aside the abovementioned bankruptcy notice\",\n",
       "  \"Mr Pacer's application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of New South Wales against the Local Court judgment was dismissed by Rothman J on 22 June 2005 with costs\",\n",
       "  'At the time the bankruptcy notice was originally filed, those costs had not been assessed',\n",
       "  'In his subsequent affidavit sworn 7 September 2005 and filed in support of his application to set aside the bankruptcy notice, Mr Pacer deposed that on 12 August 2005, he had attended the registry of the Downing Centre Local Court, whereupon he attempted to file an application to satisfy the Local Court judgment by instalments',\n",
       "  'Mr Pacer asserted that he was informed by the filing clerk that no such application could be made, since the judgment had not yet been formally entered',\n",
       "  'It appears to be common ground between the parties that the Local Court judgment in favour of Star Kitchens was subsequently entered four days later on 16 August 2005, the certificate of judgment recording a judgment debt of $27,354.32',\n",
       "  'Curiously however, that certificate of judgment, which was annexed to the bankruptcy notice, stated that the judgment was entered on 8 April 2004, being the date of delivery of judgment, whereas the certificate of judgment is dated 16 August 2005',\n",
       "  'There is no apparent evidence to indicate that Mr Pacer was served with that certificate of judgment, or had it otherwise brought to his attention by Star Kitchens, for what that might ultimately matter',\n",
       "  'Star Kitchens then filed the bankruptcy notice on 24 August 2005 and personally caused the same to be served (as stated above) upon Mr Pacer on 29 August 2005',\n",
       "  'The bankruptcy notice served on Mr Pacer referred to an amount outstanding of $30,733.51; that amount comprised the abovementioned sum of $27,354.32 recorded on the certificate of Local Court judgment as well as an amount claimed in respect of interest accrued since the date of judgment',\n",
       "  \"The calculation of that interest was explained in note 2 as follows:  'Judgment was entered against Frank Pacer in the Downing Centre Local Court on 8 April 2004 for the sum of $27,354.32, plus interest to Judgment date...   Interest on the Judgment debt is being claimed for the period from 9 April 2004 to 22 August 2005...' It is apparent from the Magistrate's reasons for judgment that the amount awarded on 8 April 2004 by way of quantum meruit was actually $19,820 plus costs, rather than $27,354.32\",\n",
       "  'The costs order made against Mr Pacer in the Local Court proceeding initiated by Star Kitchens had not been assessed as at the time of filing the notice, and therefore the costs the subject of that order must have formed no part of the $27,354.32 judgment debt',\n",
       "  'In that regard it seems likely that the figure of $27,354.32 recorded in the certificate of judgment, which was of course issued on 16 August 2005, incorporated the interest outstanding on the $19,820 judgment, calculated from 12 May 2000 to 16 August 2005, as ordered by the Magistrate',\n",
       "  'In those circumstances the bankruptcy notice would seem to have overstated the amount outstanding, insofar as it purported to levy interest upon the difference between $27,354.32 and $19,820 during the period from 8 April 2004 to 16 August 2005',\n",
       "  'That is not however fatal to the notice: see s 41(5) of the Act and Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 (Full High Court 4 April 2006)',\n",
       "  \"Before addressing the submissions made by the parties in respect of the application to set aside the judgment, it is appropriate to describe in more detail Mr Pacer's subsequent applications in the Local Court\",\n",
       "  \"On 12 August 2005, following upon the Supreme Court's dismissal of his appeal from the Local Court judgment, Mr Pacer filed an amended statement of liquidated claim in proceedings no\",\n",
       "  'of 2004, which he had commenced in the Downing Centre Local Court against Star Kitchens on 12 November 2004 as I have earlier recorded',\n",
       "  'Also on 12 August 2005, Mr Pacer filed a notice of motion for a stay of the original Local Court judgment until the determination of those new proceedings',\n",
       "  \"On 18 August 2005, Star Kitchens filed a notice of motion seeking to have Mr Pacer's statement of claim struck out, pursuant either to Part 13 rule 4 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules , as being frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of the process of the Court, or pursuant to Part 14 rule 28 as an abuse of process of the Court\",\n",
       "  \"Star Kitchen's notice of motion of 18 August 2005 sought in the alternative an order for security for costs and a stay until such security was provided\",\n",
       "  \"On 10 October 2005 a Magistrate dismissed Star Kitchen's application for summary dismissal\",\n",
       "  'The Magistrate ordered that a stay of the original Local Court judgment should be granted, subject to Mr Pacer paying the abovementioned amount of $27,354.32 into Court as well as an amount necessary to cover the assessed costs of the original Local Court proceedings which had been successfully prosecuted by Star Kitchens, and also the costs of the proceedings in the Supreme Court',\n",
       "  'The costs of the original Local Court proceedings were assessed and recorded as $17,490.89 in a certificate of judgment dated 14 October 2005',\n",
       "  \"On the same day a certificate of judgment also issued out of the Local Court which recorded Star Kitchen's assessed costs of the Supreme Court proceedings as $9,168.36\",\n",
       "  'On 1 November 2005, Mr Pacer filed an application in the Local Court seeking leave to pay the Local Court judgment debt and costs by instalments',\n",
       "  'That application was refused by a registrar of the Local Court on 3 November 2005',\n",
       "  'Moreover on 17 November 2005, a magistrate ordered that the stay of execution upon the original Local Court judgment be lifted, since Mr Pacer had failed to pay any money into court',\n",
       "  \"The Magistrate also ordered the registrar to reconsider Mr Pacer's application to repay the judgment debt by instalments\",\n",
       "  \"I was informed by counsel for Mr Pacer that an order was made by the Local Court on 13 December 2005 to the effect that the debt be paid by instalments, pending the hearing of Mr Pacer's action against Star Kitchens\",\n",
       "  'The instalment regime was that the debt be paid by an instalment of $2000 on 31 January 2006, with monthly payments of $1500 to be made thereafter until the Local Court hearing scheduled to commence on 10 May 2006',\n",
       "  \"The respective positions of the parties  12 In the proceedings before me on 7 March 2006, counsel for Star Kitchens conceded that while some payments were received late, there was 'nothing outstanding under the payment regime'\",\n",
       "  'I was also referred to evidence to the effect that on 6 December 2005, Mr Pacer made a payment of $4000 in two cheques to Star Kitchen, and that such amount was also to be deducted from the indebtedness of Mr Pacer',\n",
       "  'It was evident that the amount the subject of the bankruptcy notice had been substantially reduced, and counsel for Mr Pacer submitted that in those circumstances, it was appropriate that the bankruptcy notice filed on 24 August 2005 by Star Kitchens be dismissed',\n",
       "  \"It was further submitted that '[t]o allow the bankruptcy notice to remain on foot... [was] really an abuse of process' as its retention was being used for a collateral purpose\",\n",
       "  \"Star Kitchen's stated position was that the status quo should be maintained, and that the current proceedings should be adjourned pending the Local Court hearing beginning on 10 May 2006, due to the fact that 'if the Local Court proceedings are resolved in favour of [Star Kitchens] then... there would be a wish at that stage to pursue the bankruptcy remedy'\",\n",
       "  \"Star Kitchen contended moreover that the stay on payment of the Local Court fees was dependent upon Mr Pacer's ongoing co-operation in the payment of instalments, as and when they fell due, and that the stay 'could lapse at any time'\",\n",
       "  'However, it was conceded by Star Kitchens that it would not suffer any prejudice if the bankruptcy notice was to be set aside',\n",
       "  'It was mutually agreed that whether or not the status quo should be maintained boiled down to the exercise of judicial discretion, and counsel for both parties were requested to provide submissions on the implications that would arise in the event that the bankruptcy notice was set aside',\n",
       "  \"Mr Pacer's submissions were that the discretion ought to be exercised in Mr Pacer's favour for three reasons\",\n",
       "  'The first was that there was no present ground for allowing the bankruptcy notice to stand, as the stay and instalment orders made by the Local Court had been complied with',\n",
       "  \"The second reason was that the bankruptcy notice prejudiced Mr Pacer due to the fact that he was 'reluctant to tender for a number of projects currently available to him' where he was required to disclose that these proceedings are on foot\",\n",
       "  \"The third ground was stated to be 'the efficient use of judicial resources', however no elucidation was provided on that point\",\n",
       "  'It was concluded that the bankruptcy notice should be set aside either with costs or with costs reserved for short argument at a time after the Local Court proceedings had been resolved',\n",
       "  \"To the contrary, Star Kitchen's submission was that no order should presently be made, including any order for costs, until the outcome of the Local Court proceedings was known and submissions as to the merits could be made\",\n",
       "  'Conclusions  16 The submissions of counsel for Mr Pacer have not inconsiderable force, and the way in which my discretion should be exercised has caused me a measure of concern',\n",
       "  'I am presently persuaded to the view that the most appropriate course, in the light of the history of disputation between the parties, is for the proceedings presently in this Court to remain in their present stage of abeyance until the outcome of the Local Court proceedings, which must by now be imminent, is known',\n",

       "  'The requirements of s. 52 are essential requirements for the proof of the petition',\n",

       "  'It stated that judgment was entered against Mr Roskell in the Local Court on 22 June 2000 and that interest was claimed from the date of judgment to 15 December 2004',\n",
       "  'The attachment went on to say that interest was claimed under s 39 of the District Court (Civil Claims) Act 1970 (NSW)',\n",
       "  'That was an error and was struck out by a handwritten amendment, apparently by an officer of the Official Receiver prior to the issue of the bankruptcy notice',\n",
       "  'It was replaced by a reference to s 85 of the District Court Act 1973 (NSW)',\n",
       "  'However, that too was an error because in fact interest should have been claimed under s 39 of the Local Court (Civil Claims) Act 1970 (NSW)',\n",
       "  'The attachment then set out the applicable interest rates payable for the period from 22 June 2000 to 15 December 2004 and a calculation of the total amount of interest payable',\n",

       "  'Mr Roskell was not legally represented and was happy to adopt those points as grounds of opposition to the petition; see at [5]',\n",
       "  'The first ground was that the certificate stated that interest was not payable on the amount of costs assessed but the bankruptcy notice claimed interest of $16,509.96',\n",
       "  'The second ground was the incorrect statement of the statutory source of liability for post-judgment interest',\n",

       "  'A fter the decision in Adams was handed down, Driver FM called for written submissions to be delivered by the parties by 26 April 2006',\n",

       "  'It was in this context that he went on to deal with the two errors that he had identified',\n",
       "  'His Honour seems to have proceeded on the basis that the statement in the costs certificate that interest was not payable was an error',\n",
       "  \"He described it as an error in [16] although he accepted the appellant's submission that it was a reference to pre-judgment interest\",\n",
       "  'It would have followed from this that the statement was perfectly correct, the only error being the incorrect reference to s 203E of the Legal Profession Act',\n",
       "  'Indeed, his Honour went on to say that if the correct provision of the Legal Profession Act had been identified, Mr Roskell could probably have worked out that the statement in the costs certificate referred only to pre-judgment interest',\n",
       "  'His Honour then referred to the second error, namely the statement in the interest calculation attached to the bankruptcy notice, that interest was claimed under s 85 of the District Court Act',\n",

       "  \"The substance of his Honour's reasons appears in the following two paragraphs as follows:  [19] Mr Roskell was then confronted with a second bankruptcy notice which claimed a smaller principal sum than the first bankruptcy notice but which included a claim of interest in the sum of $16,509.96 making a total of $50,477.58\",\n",
       "  'In my opinion, a debtor in the position of Mr Roskell would have been left hopelessly confused',\n",

       "  'It would have been next to impossible for him to check his liability because both the certificate of judgment and the bankruptcy notice referred to incorrect statutory provisions',\n",
       "  '[20] It is true that Mr Roskell could have disputed the claim of interest on the second bankruptcy notice by giving notice pursuant to s.41(5)',\n",
       "  'He did not do so',\n",
       "  'However, in my view, the bankruptcy notice, coupled with the costs certificate and the earlier bankruptcy notice was so confusing as to have left Mr Roskell in no position to determine whether he was entitled to make such a claim',\n",
       "  'Notice pursuant to s.41(5) must be given before the time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice expires',\n",
       "  'It is now too late for such a notice to be given',\n",
       "  'In my view, the confusion created by the errors in the second bankruptcy notice and its attached certificate gave rise to confusion resulting in injustice which is now irremediable',\n",
       "  'It follows that the defects are substantive and not formal and cannot be corrected pursuant to s.306 of the Bankruptcy Act',\n",
       "  'Whether the Federal Magistrate correctly applied the principles stated in Adams  29 The High Court said in Adams at [18] that if there is a failure to comply with a provision of the Bankruptcy Act or the Regulations, the first question which must be asked is whether the defect or irregularity is a formal one within the purview of s 306',\n",
       "  'If it is, it is then necessary to ask whether substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity and whether the injustice cannot be remedied by an order of the Court',\n",

       "  'The first question, that is, whether the defect or irregularity is formal, involves two levels of enquiry',\n",

       "  'The relevant enquiry is: does the bankruptcy notice fail to meet a requirement made essential by the Act or the Regulations; or could it reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice; see Kleinwort Benson at 79; Adams at [25]',\n",
       "  'In the present case the first defect identified by the learned magistrate was that the costs certificate stated that interest was not payable on the amount of costs assessed',\n",

       "  'His Honour correctly accepted at [16] that this was a statement that no interest was payable up until judgment',\n",
       "  'That should have been sufficient to dispose of the issue',\n",
       "  'I do not see how the incorrect reference to s 203E of the Legal Profession Act converted the correct statement about pre-judgment interest into an error in the bankruptcy notice',\n",
       "  'Even if the incorrect reference to the section of the Legal Profession Act is to be treated as a defect, in my opinion it was a formal one',\n",
       "  'My reasons for this view are stated in the following paragraphs',\n",
       "  'Regulation 4.02 and Form 1 of the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 (Cth) requires the bankruptcy notice to state the provision under which interest is being claimed',\n",

       "  'Moreover, consistently with the observation of the Court in Adams , it cannot be said that a mistaken reference to the section of the Legal Profession Act could be said to have been an essential requirement for validity of the notice or to have misled the debtor as to what was necessary to comply with it',\n",
       "  'Upon the proper construction of the bankruptcy notice as a whole, it was plain that interest was being claimed only post-judgment',\n",

       "  'The bankruptcy notice in the present case is therefore indistinguishable from the notice in Adams',\n",
       "  'That is to say the only defect was the second error identified by Driver FM, namely an incorrect citation of the source of entitlement to post-judgment interest',\n",
       "  'That was a formal defect within the purview of s 306 of the Act, not a substantive one as found by the Federal Magistrate; see Adams at [32] --- [34]',\n",

       "  'The extent to which the alleged conduct of the respondents impaired the capacity of Cosdean to sell all 500,000 key rings is clearly an important factual issue',\n",
       "  'Of course, I cannot decide those factual issues on the present application',\n",

       "  'The consequence is said to be that the applicant has a good prospect of recovering quite substantial damages against one or both of the respondents, so that it should be permitted to maintain its claim without being obliged to pay further security for costs',\n",
       "  'The third of the points raised in written argument concerns the availability of funds to purchase the additional 450,000 key rings which the applicant was obliged to acquire from Deumer Asia',\n",
       "  'It is argued, based in part upon contested evidence in the case upon which there has been no adjudication and in part upon proposed evidence as expressed in witness statements (including of a director of Unique Finance Pty Ltd), that funds would have been made available upon certain terms (including interest at the rate of 60 per cent per annum) to meet the shipment of the balance of key rings so that it could have acquired the additional 450,000 key rings and (as asserted in its second point) would have onsold them at a large profit',\n",

       "  'In my view, apart from it becoming clearer that Deumer Asia would not generally fund proceedings, the applicant has not shown that it has made a cogent and sensible approach to Deumer Asia for it to support the proceedings by presenting a limited claim for financial support (sufficient to meet the requested security for costs only), and by explaining anything about the nature of the action or its prospect of success',\n",
       "  'Importantly, for the purposes of the application for a further extension of time within which to appeal, I do not think that a letter of such generality without more is sufficient to indicate that Deumer Asia has received a detailed and properly constructed request for financial assistance and has declined it so that the principal creditor who will mainly benefit from the proceeding, if it is successful, has declined to support the proceedings and as a result the proceedings will be stultified',\n",
       "  'Its letter is far too general for that',\n",

       "  'The sales to that date had not generated anywhere near sufficient funds to pay for the second tranche (or some of it)',\n",
       "  'It had no other funds, other than borrowed funds, to do so',\n",

       "  'Having regard to the sales to 25 May 2006, even allowing for increasing public interest as the World Cup became closer and occurred, the prospect of a very dramatic upturn in sales in that period is not immediately attractive',\n",
       "  'That is the more so having regard to the evidence about the efforts to market the key rings through member or associated clubs of the respondents prior to 25 May 2006, and that the interest of such clubs was neither consistently positive nor likely to generate large sales of key rings, at any one particular club',\n",
       "  'On the evidence, the sales strategy of the applicant through member or allied clubs of the respondents was close to its last ditch plan after several other plans had been tried and had not resulted in significant sales',\n",
       "  'Moreover, the contention asserts that sales of the first tranche would in part have funded the balance of the key rings',\n",
       "  'As the sales of almost half of the first tranche to 25 May 2006 had not put the applicant in a position to do so, it must be referring to the balance of the first 50,000 key rings',\n",
       "  'On its best case, those sales would have taken place in June 2006',\n",
       "  'The surplus funds generated may, therefore, not have been available to fund the second tranche or the part of it comprising 350,000 key rings at a point in time which was early enough to ensure the availability of that second tranche or part of it at the critical time prior to and during the World Cup',\n",
       "  'The balance of the second tranche, namely 100,000 key rings had not been ordered and, as the evidence showed, with a considerable period between order and availability of the first tranche and of that part of the second tranche comprising 350,000 key rings, it may be doubted that they would be available at or before the World Cup',\n",

       "  'His Honour there observed that the authorities indicate that an applicant must satisfy the Court of three interrelated, and sometimes overlapping matters: first, that he or she has a \" prima facie case\", even if evidence is not adduced which would be admissible on a final hearing; second, that he or she has \"a fair chance of success\"; third, that the claim is \"genuine\" or \" bona fide',\n",
       "  '\" 53 Lindgren J summed up the test as follows at [12]:  Perhaps little more can usefully be said than that a debtor must satisfy the court that there is sufficient substance to the counter-claim, set-off or cross-demand asserted to make it one which the debtor should, in justice, be permitted to have heard and determined in the usual way, rather than be forced to comply with the bankruptcy notice by payment or to commit an act of bankruptcy',\n",
       "  'I have no doubt that Mr Dekkan believes he has a genuine claim but the authorities show that this is not sufficient; what is required is that the Court must be satisfied that it is just that the claim should be determined before the bankruptcy proceedings are allowed to continue: Re Brink: Ex parte CBC at 438',\n",
       "  'Whether the test be expressed as a prima facie case, or a fair chance of success, it is plain that the claim propounded by Mr Dekkan does not reach either threshold',\n",
       "  'There are four reasons for this',\n",
       "  \"First, the substance of Mr Dekkan's claim in relation to the appeal to the Court of Appeal was that Mrs Evans ought, instead, to have filed a motion in the District Court to set aside the judgment of Kearns DCJ\",\n",
       "  'There was nothing to suggest that this was a more appropriate course than an appeal, or that any different result would have been produced',\n",

       "  'No want of care was demonstrated in the present case',\n",

       "  'However, Mr Katsinas was not briefed on a \"no win, no fee\" basis, and there was nothing to suggest that the solicitors\\' fees were incurred improperly',\n",
       "  'Third, Mr Dekkan\\'s claim that Ms Evans failed to assist him after her retainer was terminated does not give rise to a \"counter-claim, set-off or cross demand\"',\n",

His Honour went on to observe, both in respect to the role played by Ms Wagner and Mr Holmes: [17] Nevertheless, I concluded that I was obliged to hear the whole of these proceedings for two reasons',\n",

       "  'At their meetings on 30 April 2008, the creditors of the respective companies resolved that their meeting be adjourned to 3 July 2008 at the offices of Jirsch Sutherland, in the case of ZLM at 10.30 am and in the case of LMP at 11.00 am',\n",
       "  'The period of the adjournment did not exceed the period of 45 business days allowed by s 439B(2) of the Act',\n",
       "  'By a letter dated 30 May 2008 Mr Lumley proposed to Mr Sutherland that LMP and ZLM execute a deed or deeds of company arrangement, and by a letter dated 20 June 2008, Mr Miskiewicz similarly proposed to Mr Sutherland that LMP and ZLM execute a deed or deeds of company arrangement',\n",
       "  'It must be said at once that the proposals, as expressed in the letters, are extremely vague',\n",

       "  'He did not notify or remind creditors of either company that the meetings had been adjourned to 3 July 2008',\n",
       "  'In his affidavit, Mr Sutherland has explained the oversight as follows: 44',\n",
       "  'Although the dates for the adjourned meeting were entered into a centralised diary system which members of my staff and I maintain for the purpose of keeping track of various deadlines in respect of the administrations under my control, no entry was made to enable preparation of a further supplementary report to creditors providing an update on my Investigations and a recommendation in relation to the resolution of creditors at the adjourned second meeting',\n",
       "  'Inadvertently, the date for the holding of the second meeting of creditors of LMP and ZLM was missed by me and my staff',\n",

       "  'In the result, the proposals of Mr Lumley and Mr Miskiewicz, whether in their present form or in any more refined form, were not put to the creditors',\n",
       "  \"Mr Sutherland has taken certain steps to ensure that his firm's centralised diary system now allows only the person who enters the relevant diary entry to delete it, and he expects that meeting dates will not be inadvertently deleted in the future\",\n",
       "  'On 9 July 2008 Mr Sutherland sent a notice to the creditors of each company advising them that the adjourned second meeting of creditors had not been \"convened\"',\n",
       "  'No doubt, he meant that he had not notified or reminded creditors of the adjournment that had been resolved upon at the meeting of creditors on 30 April 2008',\n",
       "  \"In his notice of 9 July 2008, Mr Sutherland advised creditors that:   • he had not completed his investigations into the affairs of the companies; • he had received proposals from the companies' directors for a deed of company arrangement; • in his opinion his investigation should be completed so that he could provide creditors with sufficient information to enable them to make an informed decision when determining on the companies' future; and • he was applying to the Court for an extension of the convening periods pursuant to s 439A(6) of the Act\",\n",

       "  'According to his affidavit, no creditor notified him of any objection',\n",
       "  'CONSIDERATION  18 Although it makes no difference for present purposes, contrary to what was submitted the second meeting of the creditors of each company did not end on 3 July 2008, but on 30 April 2008',\n",
       "  'The correct analysis is as follows',\n",
       "  \"The adjournment was effected by the creditors' resolutions in exercise of the power to adjourn given by s 439B(2)\",\n",
       "  'It may have been good practice, but it was not required by law, for Mr Sutherland to send out notices reminding or advising creditors of the adjourned date',\n",
       "  'If the number of creditors required for a quorum had been present on 3 July 2008, it would have been the same meeting that continued on that date',\n",
       "  'However, the adjournment was aborted by the absence of a quorum, indeed the absence of any creditors at all, on 3 July 2008',\n",
       "  'In those circumstances, the meeting did not resume on 3 July 2008',\n",
       "  'An analogy is the situation in which all present at a meeting leave: obviously the meeting does not continue beyond the last moment when a quorum was present',\n",
       "  'In the present case, that moment was at the end of the meeting on 30 April 2008',\n",
       "  'The meeting ended then',\n",
       "  'It follows that the voluntary administrations came to an end on that date',\n",
       "  'This is because s 435C(1)(b) of the Act provides that an administration ends on the happening of whichever event of a kind referred to in subs (2) or (3) of s 435C happens first after the administration begins, and the only relevant event in the present case is that identified in para (e) of s 435C(3) which is as follows:   (e) ... a meeting convened under section 439A ends (whether or not it was earlier adjourned) without a resolution under section 439C being passed at the meeting; ...  The reference to a resolution under s 439C is a reference to the passing of a resolution at the meeting of creditors convened under s 439A that the company execute a deed of company arrangement or that the administration should end or that the company be wound up',\n",
       "  'Since the administration ended on 3 July 2008, the directors have been at liberty to perform or exercise their functions and powers as directors: see s 437C(1) and (2) of the Act',\n",
       "  'Mr Sutherland has given evidence of the results of his investigations to date, which, in brief, show that:   • his investigations have been hampered by the failure of the directors to lodge reports as to affairs; • the affairs of the two companies have been intermingled; • between them, LMP and ZLM own twelve properties; • there is an unusually high number of mortgages and caveats over the properties; • there appear to be numerous related party transactions (other than transactions between LMP and ZLM); • in order to provide a useful report to the creditors of ZLM and LMP, it is essential that Mr Sutherland complete his investigations of the bank accounts of the companies and identify the application of the funds obtained from various creditors; • Mr Sutherland has identified a number of other assets or interests in assets which LMP and ZLM may have which may be available for the benefit of creditors',\n",
       "  'It is desirable that Mr Sutherland be enabled to complete his investigations and report the results to creditors and that creditors have the opportunity of considering his report and deciding that the companies be wound up or that the administration should end or that they enter into a deed of company arrangement',\n",
       "  'If a means cannot be found to facilitate the re-convening of the second meeting of creditors, it would be necessary, in order for the present stage to be reached again, for the companies again to appoint an administrator under s 436A of the Act and for the statutory procedure again to be followed',\n",
       "  'It is in the interests of creditors that a more expeditious course be followed if one is available',\n",
       "  'The present application by Mr Sutherland has, however, been based on the misconception',\n",
       "  'In the originating process, Mr Sutherland has referred to s 439B(2) of the Act, which provides: A meeting convened under section 439A may be adjourned from time to time, but the period of the adjournment, or the total of the periods of adjournment, must not exceed 45 business days',\n",
       "  'In the originating process, Mr Sutherland sought an order under s 447A of the Act to the effect that Pt 5.3A of the Act is to operate in relation to each company as if s 439B(2) had the effect that an adjournment to a date not later than 1 August 2008 was permitted',\n",
       "  'As I pointed out on the hearing, this might have been appropriate relief if the creditors had in fact resolved to adjourn the meeting to 1 August 2008, but they did not do so',\n",
       "  'The order sought would be of no avail in circumstances in which the creditors in fact resolved on 30 April 2008 to adjourn their meeting to 3 July 2008 and the meeting did not resume on that date',\n",
       "  'Mr Sutherland faces two problems: first, the administration ended on 30 April 2008; and, second, the convening period expired on 22 April 2008',\n",
       "  'The solution to the first problem is the making of an order under s 447A having the effect that in the present case, notwithstanding s 435C(1)(b) and (3)(e), the administration does not end where the meeting is adjourned to a date that is no more than 45 days after the first day on which the meeting was held (as permitted by s 439B(2) of the Act), and on that date, through oversight, neither the administrator nor any creditor of the company attends the adjourned meeting',\n",
       "  'Section 447A of the Act empowers the Court to make such order as it thinks appropriate about how Pt 5.3A is to operate in relation to a particular company',\n",
       "  'The section is broad enough to permit the making of an order that has some retrospective effect, and, in particular, the effect of overcoming the ending of an administration that has occurred by the operation of the Act; see Re Greg Sewell Forgings Pty Ltd (1995) 17 ACSR 602 ; Re Madden (1996) 20 ACSR 10',\n",
       "  'I raised with the solicitor who appeared for Mr Sutherland the necessity of having evidence that the directors had not in fact resumed control of the companies and committed them to transactions',\n",
       "  'Evidence has been led by Michael Chan, a senior manager employed by Jirsch Sutherland, who had day to day carriage of the voluntary administrations of LMP and ZLM, to the effect that following the appointment of Mr Sutherland, Mr Chan organised for the following to occur:   • to receive all of the cheque books for the bank accounts operated by ZLM and LMP; • to notify the companies\\' bank of Mr Sutherland\\'s appointment and ask for the companies\\' bank accounts to be \"frozen\" and the proceeds to be paid to Mr Sutherland as administrator; and • to instruct solicitors to lodge caveats in the name of Mr Sutherland as administrator on all properties registered in the names of the companies',\n",
       "  'Mr Chan states that so far as he is aware, there is no reason to think that the directors would have understood that the administrations of the companies had ended',\n",
       "  \"He states that so far as he is aware, the directors have not purported to take any steps on behalf of the companies or to act as directors of them since Mr Sutherland's appointment as administrator on 14 March 2008\",\n",
       "  'I am satisfied that the directors have probably not resumed an active role in the affairs of the company',\n",
       "  'The second problem to which I referred at [25] above can be overcome simply by the making of an order under s 439A(6) of the Act extending the convening period',\n",
       "  'Since the Act was amended by the Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Act 2007 (Cth) (Act No 132 of 2007), such an order may be made on an application made after the convening period as well as during it',\n",
       "  'It is appropriate to extend the convening period to 28 July 2008',\n",

       "  \"Indeed, Mr Kurland's evidence as to the $50,000 success fee allegedly made a few weeks after the 21 September 1995 meeting is contradicted by the fact that no amendment was made to the Retainer Agreement to include this term\",\n",

       "  '[42] The antecedents of s 41(5) of the Bankruptcy Act are to be found in s 16(2) of the Bankruptcy and Deeds of Arrangement Act 1913 (UK) (the 1913 Act)',\n",
       "  'This subsection provided that a bankruptcy notice issued in respect of a judgment debt under s 4(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act 1883 (UK) (the predecessor of s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act) was not to be invalidated in certain circumstances',\n",
       "  'Section 16(2) was in the following terms:   \"(2) Notwithstanding anything in the said paragraph (g):  ...     (ii) a bankruptcy notice shall not be invalidated by reason only that the sum specified in the notice as the amount due exceeds the amount actually due, unless the debtor within the time allowed for payment gives notice to the creditor that he disputes the validity of the notice on the ground of such misstatement, but, if the debtor does not give such notice, he shall be deemed to have complied with the bankruptcy notice if within the time allowed he takes such steps as would have constituted a compliance with the notice had the actual amount due been correctly specified therein',\n",
       "  '\"  [43] It has been accepted that s 16(2) of the 1913 Act and its Australian counterparts were enacted to overcome the decision by the Court of Appeal in Re a Debtor [1908] 2 KB 692; Re Prossimo; Ex parte De Marco (1952) 16 ABC 86 (Clyne J) at 88; Olivieri v Stafford at 415, per Sweeney ACJ, dissenting (but whose dissent does not affect this question)',\n",
       "  'In Re a Debtor, the bankruptcy notice, which claimed payment of [sterling]984 7s 1d, overstated the interest component by [sterling]1 5s 4d',\n",
       "  'Cozens-Hardy MR rejected (at 687) the proposition that the overstatement was a mere \"formal defect\" that fell within s 143(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1883 (UK) (the forerunner of s 306(1) of the Bankruptcy Act)',\n",
       "  'In his view, to claim payment of a sum that was never due was a substantial defect, regardless of the precise amount of the mistake',\n",
       "  'Farwell LJ expressed a similar opinion, observing that the statute had to be \"strictly followed\"',\n",
       "  'He said this (at 689-690):   \"I cannot think it is a mere formal defect to include in a bankruptcy notice not only the amount payable under the judgment, but also a sum which is not due and owing at all, and which the debtor has no means of seeing on the face of the notice is not due and owing',\n",
       "  '\"  [44] As Sweeney ACJ observed in Olivieri v Stafford at 416, the language employed in s 16(2) of the 1913 Act was not limited to the situation which arose in that case (and in the present case), where the bankruptcy notice required the debtor to pay a judgment debt which was due and a further statement of interest, a portion of which was not due',\n",
       "  'The expression used --- \"the sum specified in the notice as the amount due exceeds the amount actually due\" -- was apt to cover any factual situation which produced an overstatement of the amount due',\n",
       "  '[45] Section 16(2) of the 1913 Act was reproduced as proviso (ii) to s 2(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1914 (UK)',\n",
       "  'It was, in turn, adopted as proviso (ii) to s 53 of the 1924 Act referred to earlier',\n",
       "  'Section 53 of the 1924 Act stated that a bankruptcy notice was to be in the prescribed form and was to require the debtor to pay the judgment debt or the sum ordered to be paid in accordance with the terms of the judgment or order',\n",
       "  'In Re Prossimo, Clyne J described (at 89) proviso (ii) as in part creating an exception to the general rule that the bankruptcy notice should require the debtor to pay the judgment debt according to the terms of the judgment',\n",
       "  'The reference to the \"amount actually due\" in proviso (ii) was intended to qualify the general rule and to require the bankruptcy notice to state the actual amount due',\n",
       "  'The second part of the proviso was intended to prevent, under certain conditions, a bankruptcy notice being invalid by reason of an overstatement of the amount actually due',\n",
       "  'But where the bankruptcy notice overstated the amount actually due and the debtor gave a notice in accordance with the proviso, the bankruptcy notice was invalid',\n",
       "  'In other words, the law as stated in Re a Debtor did not apply unless the debtor gave the creditor a notice complying with proviso (ii) to s 53 of the 1924 Act',\n",
       "  '[46] Section 41(5) of the Bankruptcy Act follows the form recommended by the Report of the Committee Appointed by the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to Review the Bankruptcy Law of the Commonwealth (1962), chaired by Clyne J and including among its members the Commonwealth Parliamentary Draftsman (Mr J Q Ewens)',\n",
       "  'The Committee made the following observations on cl 41 of the draft Bill:   \"69',\n",
       "  'The provisions contained in section 53 dealing with the form, contents and service of a bankruptcy notice are considered by the Committee to be generally satisfactory, although the Committee believes that the precise requirements as to such a notice will appear more clearly from the redraft of that section contained in the Bill',\n",
       "  '\"  Section 41(5) of the Bankruptcy Act reproduces the substance of the first part of proviso (ii) to s 53 of the 1924 Act; while s 41(6) reproduces the substance of the second part of proviso (ii)',\n",
       "  '[47] Section 41(5) of the Bankruptcy Act incorporates the drafting changes suggested by the Clyne Committee and differs from the first part of proviso (ii) to s 53 in several respects',\n",
       "  'These are as follows:   • Section 41(5) is not expressed as a proviso to any other section',\n",
       "  'However, s 41(2) of the Bankruptcy Act , as originally enacted, was similar to the first part of s 53 of the 1924 Act to which par (ii) was a proviso',\n",
       "  '(Section 41(2), in its original form, was repealed in 1996 and replaced with a provision which merely requires the bankruptcy notice to be in accordance with the prescribed form)',\n",
       "  '• The subsection uses the expression \"the amount in fact due\" to replace \"the amount actually due\" in proviso (ii)',\n",
       "  '• The expression \"the misstatement\" is substituted for the phrase \"such misstatement\", which was used in proviso (ii)',\n",
       "  '[48] None of these changes is in our view significant for present purposes',\n",
       "  'There is nothing to indicate that the Clyne Committee intended that the substitution of the definite article for the word \"such\" in the concluding phrase should bring about any change in the scope and application of s 41(5) compared with its predecessor',\n",
       "  \"We of course appreciate that Clyne J had expressed the view in Re Charles Murray that a debtor's notice under proviso (ii) to s 53 of the 1924 Act did not have to set out the amount of the excess\",\n",
       "  \"It may be that his Honour intended to say no more than that a debtor's notice may be capable of complying with the proviso even if it does not specify precisely the excess improperly claimed in the bankruptcy notice\",\n",
       "  'If Clyne J meant to go further, in our respectful opinion, the language of the proviso and of s 41(5) does not warrant such a step being taken',\n",
       "  'The general comments in par 69 of the Clyne Committee Report cannot be read as a specific endorsement of the decision in Re Charles Murray',\n",
       "  \"THE EFFECT OF A SECTION 41(5) NOTICE  22 In Seovic 87 FCR, the Full Court ultimately held that the letter of 25 May 1998 from the debtor's solicitors to the creditor's solicitors did not constitute a notice within the meaning of s 41(5) of the Act\",\n",
       "  'Nevertheless, they considered the effect of a debtor\\'s notice under s 41(5) of the Act and made the following observations: [49] We have observed that s 41(5) of the Bankruptcy Act appears to be drafted on the assumption that a bankruptcy notice is liable to be \"invalidated\" if the sum specified in the notice exceeds the amount in fact due to the creditor',\n",
       "  'In Re Walsh [(1982) 47 ALR 751] , Lockhart J challenged this assumption, by holding that under the Bankruptcy Act, an over-statement of the amount due by the debtor does not necessarily vitiate the bankruptcy notice',\n",

       "  'He said he would decline to follow Re a Debtor and Re Prossimo if they stood in the way of this conclusion',\n",
       "  '[50] In Re Greenhill; Ex parte Myer (NSW) Ltd (1984) 5 FCR 84 , Morling J declined to follow Re Walsh and held that an over-statement in a bankruptcy of the amount actually due renders the notice invalid, whether or not the over-statement could reasonably mislead the debtor',\n",
       "  \"Morling J considered that observations by the High Court in Walsh v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1984] HCA 33 ; [(1984) 156 CLR 337] ... were inconsistent with Lockhart J's analysis\",\n",
       "  'A similar view was subsequently taken by Pincus J in Re Emerson; Ex parte Wreckair Pty Ltd (1991) 101 ALR 315 at 318-319 (affirmed on other grounds: Emerson v Wreckair Pty Ltd [1992] FCA 16 ; (1992) 33 FCR 581 (FC))',\n",
       "  '[51] We have acted on the assumption, not challenged by either party, that Re Greenhill and Re Emerson correctly state the law',\n",
       "  \"However, our view would not be changed if Lockhart J's decision in Re Walsh were ultimately found to be correct (as to which we express no view)\",\n",
       "  'As indicated at [51] of its reasons in Seovic , the Full Court was prepared to act on the assumption that Re Greenhill and Re Emerson correctly state the law, that is, that an overstatement in a bankruptcy notice of the amount in fact due renders the notice invalid, whether or not the overstatement could reasonably mislead the debtor, if a notice complying with the requirements of s 41(5) has been duly given',\n",
       "  'I am prepared to proceed on the same assumption',\n",
       "  'That assumption is supported by the observation, albeit obiter , of Gibbs CJ in Walsh v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1984] HCA 33 ; (1984) 156 CLR 337 at 339: There is no doubt that a bankruptcy notice will be invalid if the sum specified in the notice as the amount due to the creditor exceeds the amount for which the creditor is entitled to issue execution, provided that the debtor gives timely notice under s. 41(5) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), as amended, that he disputes the validity of the notice on that ground',\n",
       "  'with whom Mason, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ agreed',\n",
       "  \"It is important, in my view, that the section uses the word 'unless' and not 'until'\",\n",
       "  'In other words, invalidity of the bankruptcy notice does not only run from the time of the giving of the s 41(5) notice; once a s 41(5) notice is given, invalidity is visited upon the bankruptcy notice from the time of its issue',\n",
       "  \"Of course the foregoing assumes that the notice given by the debtor complies with the requirements of s 41(5) , cf., Seovic 87 FCR, and that the debtor's notice cannot be challenged on some other ground such as that the bankruptcy notice does not overstate the amount actually due\",\n",
       "  'It would be open to a creditor, in an appropriate case, to challenge a purported s 41(5) notice on either basis, but there is no foundation for a challenge on either basis in the present case',\n",
       "  \"It follows from the foregoing, that I am unable, with respect, to agree with his Honour's reasoning at [7] of his reasons extracted at [16] above\",\n",
       "  \"First, his Honour's premise that the mere giving of notice under s 41(5) cannot invalidate a bankruptcy notice without more could only be correct where there is no overstatement in the bankruptcy notice\",\n",
       "  'They are not the facts here',\n",
       "  'Second, his reason for coming to that conclusion --- because that would not allow for a situation in which the recipient of the notice could challenge the alleged overstatement --- does not provide any support because it would always be open to the creditor, in an appropriate case, to challenge a purported s 41(5) notice on either of the bases referred to in [26] above',\n",
       "  'Third, the invalidity of a bankruptcy notice that has its source of invalidity in its overstatement of the amount in fact due and the timely giving by the debtor to the creditor of a notice that complies with the requirements of s 41(5) is not dependant upon some declaration by a court',\n",
       "  'In these circumstances, declaration of invalidity by a court is merely declaratory of the operation of the Act to those facts',\n",
       "  'ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION  28 I am of the view that it would be open to a court to amend, pursuant to s 33(1)(b) of the Act, a bankruptcy notice that overstated the amount due prior to the debtor giving notice to the creditor pursuant to s 41(5) of the Act',\n",
       "  'If the overstatement is due to clerical error and is one that could not reasonably mislead the debtor, then it may not even be necessary to rely on s 33(1)(b) at all; s 306(1) of the Act may, in those circumstances, save the proceeding',\n",
       "  'The more difficult question is whether a court is empowered, in reliance on s 33(1)(b) of the Act, to amend a bankruptcy notice once it has been visited with invalidity in the circumstances of the present case',\n",
       "  \"The respondent submitted that even if a bankruptcy notice is invalid by reason of an overstatement of the amount due to the creditor and the timely giving by the debtor to the creditor of a notice complying with the requirements of s 41(5), the most that this does is make failure to comply with it a non-event or, to use the words of Deane J in Kleinwort Benson 165 CLR at 81 '... failure to comply with it does not constitute an act of bankruptcy'\",\n",
       "  \"In the respondent's submission, s 33(1)(b) of the Act nevertheless empowers the court to 'cure' the invalidity by amending the notice so that the amount referred to therein corresponds with the amount due to the creditor\",\n",
       "  'This latter submission was predicated on three underlying arguments: (1) There is no express or implied restriction in the power conferred by s 33(1)(b) of the Act, such that it does not apply where a bankruptcy notice is invalid; (2) a defective bankruptcy notice is still a bankruptcy notice and therefore s 33(1)(b) applies to it; and (3) a bankruptcy notice that is liable to be invalidated is not invalid until a court declares it to be so and therefore the Bankruptcy Notice is not invalid',\n",

       "  'The Federal Magistrate did not say expressly that it was too late for the appellant to raise that claim as a ground of his application for judicial review',\n",
       "  'The way in which the Federal Magistrate dealt with the claim is set out in the following passages from his reasons for judgment: \"There is no doubt that the applicant asked for a Fujian dialect speaking interpreter but there is some doubt as to whether he speaks the truth when he says that one was not provided',\n",
       "  'At [CB 61] there is found the RRT hearing record',\n",

       "  'In the absence of any clear evidence about this I propose to proceed on the assumption that a scheme lawyer acted as he was required to do under the scheme',\n",

       "  'One such principle, which I think is uncontroversial, is that the discretion is not to be exercised so as to have the practical effect of obliterating the distinction between original and appellate jurisdiction: CDJ v VAJ [1998] HCA 67 ; (1998) 197 CLR 172 , 201-202 at [111] per McHugh, Gummow and Callinan JJ',\n",

       "  \"(a) The learned Magistrate should have concluded that the Appellant's claim lodged in the District Court of New South Wales under case number 2860 of 2007 against the Respondent for damages for professional negligence was a bona fide claim and had reasonable prospects of success, which exceeded the value of the costs judgment made in favour of the Respondent against the Appellant, such judgment being the subject of the Respondent's petition\",\n",
       "  \"(b) The learned Magistrate should have concluded that the connection between the Appellant's said claim in the District Court and the said costs judgment in favour of the Respondent was so close (the one arising out of the other) that a sequestration order should not have been made against the estate of the Appellant\",\n",
       "  '(c) The learned Magistrate should have gone behind the costs judgment',\n",
       "  '(d) The learned Magistrate should have concluded that the bankruptcy proceedings were an abuse of process or something akin to an abuse of process to warrant the exercise of a discretion to annul the bankruptcy',\n",
       "  \"(e) The learned Magistrate should have concluded that the Respondent's petition had lapsed and had not been validly renewed before the expiration of the period of 12 months commencing on the date of presentation of the petition and that accordingly, a sequestration order should not have been made against the estate of the Appellant\",\n",

       "  \"(a) The learned Magistrate should have concluded that the Appellant's claim lodged in the District Court of New South Wales under case number 2860 of 2007 against the Respondent for damages for professional negligence was a bona fide claim and had reasonable prospects of success, which exceeded the value of the costs judgment made in favour of the Respondent against the Appellant, such judgment being the subject of the Respondent's petition\",\n",

       "  '(c) The learned Magistrate should have gone behind the costs judgment',\n",

       "  \"(e) The learned Magistrate should have concluded that the Respondent's petition had lapsed and had not been validly renewed before the expiration of the period of 12 months commencing on the date of presentation of the petition and that accordingly, a sequestration order should not have been made against the estate of the Appellant\",\n",

hearing, a series of offers and counter-offers were exchanged', 'The Appellant made what was characterised by the Federal Magistrate whose decision is now under appeal as \" a series of bizarre demands ...\"', 'The dispute, however, was settled on the third day of the hearing, 23 November 2005', 'The Family Court made orders for the payment of costs against the now Appellant totalling $115,186.97', \"Those costs were not paid and a creditor's petition was served in February 2007\", 'The judgment creditor, the present Respondent, was the solicitor retained by the Appellant for the purposes of the Family Court proceedings', 'On 2 September 2008 a sequestration order was made against the Appellant, then using her married name: Murphy v Revis [2008] FMCA 1561', 'The hearing on that occasion took place in the absence of the Appellant and her then solicitor', 'Thereafter, on 22 December 2008 the Federal Magistrates Court, differently constituted, dismissed an application seeking an order under s 153B of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) that the bankruptcy be annulled: Revis v Murphy [2008] FMCA 1638', 'A Notice of Appeal was filed in this Court on 19 January 2009', 'That Notice of Appeal seeks to appeal \" from the whole of the judgment \" given on 22 December 2008', 'A Notice of Motion seeking the dismissal of the appeal was filed by the Respondent on 11 February 2009', 'The Respondent contends that the appeal should be dismissed for want of prosecution and further contends that the Notice of Appeal does not disclose any basis upon which any appeal would be upheld', 'The matter first came before this Court on 16 February 2009', 'Directions were then made for the filing and service by the Appellant of evidence in respect to the Notice of Motion prior to 18 March 2009', 'Directions were also made for the filing of submissions by the Appellant prior to 3 April 2009', 'The hearing of the Appeal and the Notice of Motion was set down for 17 April 2009', 'As at 16 February 2009 no Appeal Book had been prepared --- but steps were to be undertaken to have an Appeal Book prepared in advance of the April hearing date', 'No evidence or submissions were filed by the Appellant in accordance with the February directions and, as at 17 April 2009, no Appeal Book or any like compilation of those documents relevant to the hearing of the appeal had been prepared by the Appellant', \"Notwithstanding considerable reservation, an adjournment was granted on 17 April and the hearing of the appeal and the Respondent's Notice of Motion was adjourned to 5 May 2009\", 'That was a day by which the Appellant maintained that she would be ready to proceed', 'On 5 May 2009 the Appellant was represented by Mr Penkin of Counsel', 'Even on that date the Appellant was not ready to proceed and the matter was further adjourned to 7 May 2009', 'By an order made in the present proceeding pursuant to s 25(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), the Chief Justice has ordered that the appellate jurisdiction of this Court be exercised by a single judge', \"The hearing of the Appeal and the Respondent's Notice of Motion proceeded on 7 May 2009\", 'In addition to the parties to the appeal, the Trustee in Bankruptcy appeared for the purpose of assisting the Court', 'As submitted by the Trustee, an application for an annulment of bankruptcy, because it goes to a matter of status under the law, is different from ordinary litigation inter partes : Maas v Maas (unreported, FCA, Ryan, Heerey and Tamberlin JJ, NG 283 of 1998, 16 November 1998)', \"It is considered that the Respondent's Notice of Motion and the Appellant's Appeal should both be dismissed\", 'A VACATION OF THE HEARING DATE  It is prudent that brief reasons should be provided for adjourning the hearing from 17 April to 5 May 2009 and thereafter to 7 May 2009', 'The 17 April 2009 hearing date was fixed on 16 February 2009', 'Indeed, the April date was specifically selected so as to afford the Appellant an opportunity to secure the services of a legal representative who was said to be assisting her but then located in Western Australia', 'That legal representative was later identified as being Mr Penkin', 'Whatever the reason, the April 2009 hearing date was selected with a view to accommodating the convenience of the Appellant', 'Whatever steps were undertaken by the Appellant between 16 February and 17 April 2009, those steps were not productive of an Appeal Book being prepared', 'She did, however, attend before the Registrar on 23 February 2009 to settle the index to the Appeal Book but she then asked for further time in which \" to consult my solicitor \"', 'The assistance sought by the Appellant from Mr Penkin was not exposed, nor was there any exposition as to why Mr Penkin could not attend the Registry on 23 February', 'Nevertheless, on 10 March 2009 the Appellant again attended the Registry --- this time accompanied by Mr Penkin', 'An index to the Appeal Book was then apparently agreed', 'Notwithstanding that agreement, no Appeal Book was thereafter filed in time for the April 2009 hearing', 'Had the hearing of any appeal on that date proceeded, submissions may well have been confined to a consideration of the text of the judgment under appeal', 'Some explanation for the failure to prepare an Appeal Book may be gleaned from the fact that some days after 10 March 2009 Mr Penkin advised the Appellant that he was no longer employed by a firm of solicitors in Fremantle, McDonald Pynt Lawyers, and that he could not act for her until he was employed by another firm', 'Notwithstanding the fact that Mr Penkin was no longer employed by McDonald Pynt Lawyers, on 3 April 2009 a letter was forwarded to the Appellant from that firm confirming that \" we act for yourself in relation to the above matter \", namely the \" Annulment of Bankruptcy --- Eleanor Murphy \"', 'The letter further stated that \" [w]e await your further instructions to proceed with this matter \"', 'The letter was signed by Mr Andrew Foster', 'Presumably a reason for failure on the part of the Appellant to comply with the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) in respect to the preparation of an Appeal Book is the fact that the Appellant left such matters to Mr Penkin', 'Problems were only compounded by the fact that the 3 April 2009 letter was not read by the Appellant upon its receipt', 'The reason advanced by the Appellant was her \" religious observance of the festival of Pesach which started on the 8 th of April 2009 \" and that \" [t]he first opportunity which I could read the letter or to do any work was on Saturday night, the 11 th of April 2009 \"', 'When the Appellant availed herself of the \" first opportunity \" to read the letter, she contacted Mr Penkin on 12 April 2009 and thereafter attempts were made to secure the services of a solicitor at McDonald Pynt Lawyers', 'The Easter long weekend intervened from 10 to 13 April 2009', 'The last two days of the Pesach festival commenced at 6 pm on Tuesday 14 April and concluded on Thursday night on 16 April', 'Mr Foster was contacted on 14 April 2009', 'Neither Mr Foster nor McDonald Pynt Lawyers have filed any Notice of Appearance with this Court', 'No adequate explanation was provided by the Appellant as to the steps taken prior to intervention of Passover to ensure her appeal was ready to proceed on the day set down for hearing', 'Nor does the adherence by the Appellant to her religious beliefs provide any satisfactory explanation', 'No reason has been advanced by the Appellant as to why she did not avail herself of the opportunity to promptly attend to the 3 April 2009 letter and provide the instructions then sought prior to the commencement of her religious commitments on 8 April', 'The fact remains, however, that as at 3 April 2009 the Appellant had reason to believe that she had solicitors acting for her and that there was thereafter arguably inadequate time in which to prepare for a hearing on 17 April 2009', 'The Appellant appeared on 17 April 2009 unrepresented', 'In such circumstances, an adjournment was considered to be the only manner in which the interests of an unrepresented Appellant could at least be addressed in part', 'An adjournment also provided a further opportunity for there to be a compilation of those materials relevant to a proper consideration of her appeal', 'The hearing was accordingly adjourned until 5 May 2009', 'Shortly prior to the 5 May 2009 hearing date, the Respondent provided a bundle of documents substantially in accordance with the index to the Appeal Book that had been the subject of agreement on 10 March 2009', 'On 5 May 2009 the Appellant appeared, by now represented by Mr Penkin', 'On that occasion he sought to tender a substantial bundle of documents upon which he contended that the appeal could proceed', 'But --- even as at that date --- the bundle of documents was not complete', 'A transcript of proceedings before the Federal Magistrates Court was not included', 'Mr Penkin properly conceded that he wished to rely upon that transcript and that in the absence of the transcript the appeal could not then proceed', 'A further adjournment was granted until 7 May 2009 in order for the missing transcript to be provided', 'A further basis upon which an adjournment would have been granted was that the documents upon which Mr Penkin sought to rely had only been provided to the Respondent and the Trustee mid-afternoon on 4 May 2009', 'No proper opportunity had been given to the Respondent and the Trustee to consider that material in any detail', 'The adjournment on 5 May 2009 was granted for the purpose of enabling a bundle of documents to be prepared which contained all of the documents that satisfied the 10 March 2009 index', 'The adjournment was also granted for the purpose of enabling a further bundle of documents to be prepared by the Appellant, being those additional documents upon which she wished to rely', 'On 5 May 2009 it was unclear whether that further bundle of documents was to be the subject of an application to adduce further evidence on the appeal pursuant to s 27 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)', 'For whatever reason, no draft index of the appeal papers has been filed in the Registry as required by O 52 r 27 of the Federal Court Rules', 'Nor has there been compliance with O 52 r 28A', 'The importance of these and other obligations imposed upon an Appellant is not to be underestimated and the fact of non-compliance is not to be disregarded', 'Compliance ensures the orderly resolution of appeals and avoids the prospect of applications for adjournments or for orders seeking the dismissal of an appeal for failure to comply', 'Although an appellant has the carriage of an appeal, all parties share a responsibility to avoid incurring cost and expense ( Purvis v Dairy Adjustment Authority (No 2) [2006] FCAFC 38 at [5] , [2006] FCAFC 38 ; 150 FCR 48 at 49 per Black CJ (Branson and Finn JJ agreeing)) and a responsibility to ensure that an appeal is ready for hearing', 'An unrepresented appellant is equally as bound by these requirements as any other appellant', 'Whatever may be the shared responsibility of all parties to an appeal, non-compliance by an appellant with fundamental requirements of the Federal Court Rules cannot be the occasion for impermissibly seeking to transfer the obligations imposed upon an unrepresented Appellant to a represented Respondent', 'The obligations imposed by these Rules upon the Appellant have not been discharged', 'That failure cannot deprive a Respondent of the opportunity to have an appeal heard and resolved or dismissed', 'On occasions, a represented respondent (as in the present appeal) has assisted the Court by attempting to do that which should have been done by the appellant', 'The assistance of those representing the Respondent in preparing a compilation of documents relevant to this appeal has been appreciated', 'The adjournments granted on 17 April and 5 May 2009, it is considered, have precluded any prospect of prejudice to the present Appellant', 'Much of the delay in the resolution of what was otherwise a simple appeal within a confined context has arisen by reason of the failure on the part of the Appellant to prepare and file an Appeal Book in accordance with the Rules of this Court', 'Notwithstanding such non-compliance, further delay in the resolution of the appeal should not be entertained', 'On 7 May 2009 the case ultimately proceeded', 'A further opportunity was extended to the parties and the Trustee to file supplementary submissions after the conclusion of the appeal on 7 May 2009', 'Further submissions were in fact filed by the Appellant, together with further evidence (albeit filed without leave)', 'WANT OF PROSECUTION?', 'The Respondent contends ( inter alia ) that the appeal should be dismissed pursuant to O 52 r 38 of the Rules for \" want of prosecution \"', \"Given that the Respondent's Notice of Motion and the Appeal could both be heard within the space of the time allocated on 7 May 2009, they were heard concurrently\", 'Counsel for the Respondent, however, quite properly and frankly acknowledged that there was little utility in resolving the Motion once submissions in respect to the Appeal had been heard', 'She thus pursued the course of relying upon the Motion --- but did not wish to advance any further submissions other than those that had been advanced in her written submissions', 'If the relief sought in the Motion were granted, there would be thereafter no necessity to resolve the Appeal', 'The pragmatic course pursued by Counsel for the Respondent is accepted', 'No costs additional to those already incurred in the hearing of the appeal on 7 May 2009 were thereby incurred', 'Order 52 r 38 provides as follows:  Time; want of prosecution  (1) Where an appellant has not done any act required to be done by or under these Rules, or otherwise has not prosecuted his appeal with due diligence, the Court may: (a) order that the appeal shall be dismissed for want of prosecution;  (b) fix a time peremptorily for the doing of the act and at the same time order that upon non-compliance the appeal shall stand dismissed for want of prosecution, or subsequently and in the event of non-compliance, order that it be so dismissed; or  (c) make any other order as may seem just', '(2) The Court may not make an order under subrule (1) unless notice of the proposed order has been served on the appellant', '(3) An order under paragraph (1) (b) may be varied at any time before the appeal stands dismissed for want of prosecution, and in special circumstances may be varied or revoked after that time', 'Power is conferred upon either a single Judge or a Full Court to exercise the power to dismiss an appeal for want of prosecution: Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) s 25(2B)(ba)', 'In retrospect, and had the future defaults by the Appellant been envisaged as at 16 February 2009, it may have been more prudent for an order to have been made on that date pursuant to Rule 38(1)(b)', 'But such an order was not then made and the Notice of Appeal and the Notice of Motion ultimately came on for hearing', 'It is not considered that an order should be made in the present proceeding dismissing the appeal pursuant to O 52 r 38(1)(a)', 'The power conferred by O 52 r 38(1)(a) \" must not be lightly

considering the merits of the present application to dismiss for want of prosecution have been such factors as the commencement by the present Appellant of a District Court proceeding', 'That proceeding was commenced subsequent to the service of the petition', 'Its procedural course was the subject of criticism by the Federal Magistrates Court', 'Such factors have been left to one side, as the \" want of prosecution \" to which O 52 r 38(1)(a) is directed is a want of prosecution of the \" appeal \"; defaults or procedural irregularities in other proceedings may appear to assume little (if any) immediate relevance when that provision is invoked', 'In the present appeal, the Appellant failed to file an index to the Appeal Book , to prepare an Appeal Book or to file submissions as directed', 'After the Notice of Appeal was filed in this Court on 19 January 2009, the Appellant took no step --- or certainly undertook inadequate steps --- prior to 17 April and 5 May 2009 to ensure that her appeal would be ready for hearing', 'As was the case in Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2007] FCA 1326 at [17] , the present Appellant has been extended \" every opportunity to litigate [her] complaints \" and \" considerable procedural leeway \" has been extended to her', 'The present case is also in some ways comparable to NBCI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 280 where Ryan, Merkel and Conti JJ dismissed an appeal pursuant to O 52 r 38(1)(a) for like failures by the there appellant, those failures being characterised by their Honours as \" successive and cavalier omissions \"', 'Each case, however, must necessarily depend upon its own factual matrix', 'A failure to comply with obligations imposed by the Rules or directions of the Court made to ensure an appeal is ready for hearing may be relied upon to dismiss an appeal (e.g', 'Goldie v The Commonwealth of Australia [2004] FCA 973) --- but such failures will not in all cases necessarily lead to such an order being made (e.g', 'Jandruwanda v University of South Australia [2003] FCA 1456)', 'In the context of the present appeal, it is considered to be a more appropriate course to resolve the Notice of Appeal on such merits as it may present', 'Indeed, it may well require an exceptional case for an appeal to be dismissed for want of prosecution in circumstances where all submissions in respect to the appeal have been concluded', 'Such a course may at least provide some satisfaction to the Appellant that her case has been properly considered rather than it being dismissed for what may be regarded by her as past failings or omissions', 'If it were otherwise necessary to rely upon O 52 r 38(1)(a), it is not considered that the progress of the present appeal exposes such a \" contumelious delay \" as to warrant its dismissal upon that ground', 'The repeated failures by the Appellant to ensure that her appeal could properly be heard and resolved, however, are certainly approaching the outer limits of that which may be acceptable', \"The Respondent's Notice of Motion is to be dismissed\", 'SECTION 153B --- THE DISCRETIONARY POWER CONFERRED  The December 2008 decision of the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application made under s 153B of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) seeking an annulment of the

(ii) the Federal Magistrate erred in not concluding that the sequestration order ought not to have been made by reason of the claim sought to be advanced by the Appellant as a Plaintiff in District Court proceedings as against the judgment creditor as a Defendant to that proceeding; (iii) that the Federal Magistrate erred in not concluding that a sequestration order ought not to have been then made because there was no power as at 15 April 2008 to retrospectively extend the life of the petition or that, if there was any such power, the Appellant had been denied procedural fairness in the making of such an order when neither the Appellant nor her representatives were present;

sufficient\", 'Section 306(1) of the Act provides:  Proceedings under this Act are not invalidated by a formal defect or an irregularity, unless the court before which the objection on that ground is made is of opinion that substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity and that the injustice cannot be remedied by an order of that court', 'CONSIDERATION  14 In order to determine the issues in this appeal, it is useful to refer to the recent decision of Snelgrove v Roskell (2007) 157 FCR 313', 'In that case, Jacobson J considered whether an incorrect reference to the legislation, which was the statutory source of post-judgment interest claimed in the bankruptcy notice, resulted in the bankruptcy notice being invalid', 'In determining the correct principles to apply, his Honour held (at [29]-[31]):  The High Court said in Adams [ v Lambert (2006)] [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 at [18] that if there is a failure to comply with a provision of the Act or the Bankruptcy Regulations 1996 Cth (the Regulations), the first question which must be asked is whether the defect or irregularity is a formal one within the purview of s 306', 'If it is, it is then necessary to ask whether substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity and whether the injustice cannot be remedied by an order of the Court', 'It must be borne in mind that these are separate and distinct questions', 'The first question, that is, whether the defect or irregularity is formal, involves two levels of enquiry', 'These were stated by an earlier decision of the High Court in Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; (1988) 165 CLR 71, and applied in Adams [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 at [25] ff', 'The relevant enquiry is: does the bankruptcy notice fail to meet a requirement made essential by the Act or the Regulations; or could it reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice; see Kleinwort Benson 165 CLR at 79; Adams 225 ALR 396 at [25]', 'Apart from the reference to the Regulations in the last paragraph (to which see Gyles J at [113] in The Australian Steel Company (Operations) Pty Ltd v Lewis [2000] FCA 1915 ; (2000) 109 FCR 33 referred to later which correctly indicates that the task is to focus on the Act not the Regulations), in my view Jacobson J correctly states the matters relevant to the inquiry whether the defect or irregularity in the Notice is a formal defect or an irregularity', 'However, a preliminary matter to consider is whether the Notice was defective or irregular in any event by reason of a failure to include an interest calculation in accordance with note 2, having regard to the circumstances of this case and to the operation of s 25C of the Acts Interpretation Act', 'This preliminary matter was raised by the respondent, the federal magistrate having found, in favour of the appellant, that there was a relevant defect or irregularity in the Notice', 'If there was such a defect or irregularity, then the only remaining issue that I have been asked to determine is whether the Notice failed to meet a requirement made essential by the Act', 'The appellant did not contend that the failure to include an interest calculation could reasonably mislead a debtor as to what was necessary to comply with the Notice, but said that this was not relevant to determining whether there was a failure to comply with a requirement made essential by the Act', 'I agree', 'The relevant inquiry as described by Jacobson J consists of two aspects, which need to be addressed separately, and to the extent the federal magistrate treated both aspects together, in my respectful view he fell into error', 'However, I turn first to the preliminary matter as to whether the Notice substantially complied with the requirements of the form prescribed by the Regulations', 'In my view, the Notice does provide an equivalent to the required details of the calculation of the interest claimed as is necessary and prescribed, in the unusual circumstances surrounding the Notice', 'The following information is contained in or can be derived from the Notice:  • The 2003 Orders were made on 12 June 2003 in the amount of $569,589.65 which was the principal sum of the final judgment debt', \"• Interest which accrued since the date of the 2003 Orders was claimed pursuant to s 101(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1986 (Vic) ('the Supreme Court Act ')\", \"• Interest was determined by the Supreme Court of Victoria on the basis of the rate set by the Penalty Interest Rates Act 1983 (Vic) ('the PIR Act') from the date of the 2003 Orders to 11 October 2006\", '• The 2006 Orders were made on 31 October 2006 and the sum of $619,757.22 remained payable by the appellant to the respondent as at 11 October 2006', '• The sum of $619,757.22 included the interest claimed in the sum of $190,167.57 pursuant to the PIR Act and according to the calculation made by the binding determination of the Supreme Court of Victoria', '• No further interest was claimed', 'It is true that in the document attached to the Notice the principal sum on which the interest is claimed is not separately identified (although it can be easily derived from the information available), and no actual rate of interest is identified other than by reference to the Supreme Court Act and the PIR Act', 'However, the form prescribed by the Regulations is to adapt to the actual interest claim being made in each bankruptcy notice', 'It is not necessary in all situations to do an arithmetic calculation or to compute mathematically, and the reference to \"details of calculation\", whilst normally envisaging such a calculation or computation, do not necessarily exclude the details being provided in the way provided in this case, having regard to the interest that was claimed and the way in which it was derived', 'In this case, the respondent adapted the form to the unusual circumstances and in my view there has been substantial compliance with the prescribed form, which is sufficient (see s 25C of the Acts Interpretation Act )', 'Substantial compliance is a matter of degree', 'The court is concerned to look to the practical effect of what has been provided by way of information and the practical effect of what the form sought to achieve', 'The binding declaratory order has in effect provided the determination or calculation of the interest claimed and in this way details equivalent to the calculation of the amount of interest claimed have been provided', 'In the usual case one would expect to see a setting out of the principal sum and the exact rate applied over the period of time in which interest is claimed', 'However, if the interest has already been determined and calculated (in this case by a court), then it seems to me that for the purposes of note 2, by referring to the declaratory orders and providing the information set out above, the equivalent to the details of the calculation are provided to the debtor', 'In fact, there was probably no better or appropriate way to detail the interest claim, as both parties were bound by the 2006 Orders so far as the calculation of interest was concerned', 'I do not consider it was incumbent upon the respondent to set out an explanation as to how the figure in the declaratory order of the 2006 Orders was arrived at --- the declaratory order itself was a sufficient statement of the interest and how it was derived', 'Therefore, I consider the federal magistrate was not correct to conclude that there was a failure to comply with the prescribed form', 'In my view, there was substantial compliance with the form and on this preliminary basis the appeal should be dismissed', 'As detailed argument has been presented to me on the remaining issue, whilst it is unnecessary for me to do so, it is convenient to nevertheless consider and determine that issue', 'I observe that this question must be considered on the assumption that substantial compliance has not been achieved, for if it had, then there would be no relevant defect or irregularity', 'If then the requirement as alleged by the appellant was made essential by the Act, there being no substantial compliance, failure to comply will result in the invalidity of the Notice', 'In determining what is an essential requirement one is guided by the High Court in Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 225 ALR 396 at [25] - [26] :  In some cases the answer to that question may be easy', 'In others, a difficult question of judgment may be involved', 'The matter for judgment was identified by this court in Kleinwort Benson [165 CLR 71] at 79-81', 'In that case, the majority contrasted the concept of a formal defect or irregularity with a defect or irregularity that renders a bankruptcy notice a nullity that cannot be saved by s 306', 'To describe a defect as merely formal, or to describe a notice as a nullity, is, of course, to state a conclusion, rather than the reason for reaching that conclusion', 'Even so, it is necessary to identify the question that arises for judgment', 'The majority, referring to James [ v FCT [1955] HCA 75 ; (1955) 93 CLR 631] at 644 , and Pillai v Comptroller of Income Tax [1970] AC 1124 at 1135 , summarised the exclusionary aspect of the meaning of \"a formal defect or an irregularity\" by saying [at 79] :     The authorities show that a bankruptcy notice is a nullity if it fails to meet a requirement made essential by the Act, or if it could reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice', 'The question of construction raised by the words \"a formal defect or an irregularity\" is one to be decided by reading s 306 in the context of the whole Act, informed by the general purpose of the legislation, and the particular purpose of the provisions relating to bankruptcy notices', 'It is similar to the question that, in former times, would be explained by asking whether a statutory requirement was mandatory or directory', 'In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [(1998) [1998] HCA 28 ; 194 CLR 355 at 390-391] it was said:     A better test ... is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of [a] provision should be invalid', 'In determining the question of purpose, regard must be had to \"the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute', '\"  26 The High Court then considered whether the defect constituted a breach of an essential requirement of the Act (at [28]-[30]) (footnotes omitted):  The other exclusionary aspect of the expression \"a formal defect or an irregularity\" in s 306 was said to consist in a failure to meet a requirement made essential by the Act', 'Here again, the word \"essential\", in its application in a particular case, involves a conclusion', 'If a requirement is made essential by the Act, then a failure to meet that requirement is not a formal defect or an irregularity within the meaning of s 306', 'Whether a requirement is made essential is to be decided by a process of statutory construction undertaken in the manner described above', 'The majority in Lewis [109 FCR 33] regarded the error in that case as involving a failure to meet a requirement made essential by the Act', 'To describe an error or a deficiency in a bankruptcy notice as involving a failure to meet a requirement made essential by the Act is to state a conclusion reached after a consideration of the legislative purpose and an evaluation of the significance or importance of the error or deficiency in the circumstances of the case', 'That question is not answered by observing that there has been a failure to meet a requirement', 'In this respect, the majority in Lewis placed undue emphasis on the imperative terms of the Act and Regulations', 'If there were no failure to meet a requirement, there would be no defect or irregularity', 'Furthermore, as noted earlier, the fact that the requirement is expressed by the use of the term \"must\" is not conclusive', 'How otherwise might a requirement as to form be expressed?', 'The misdescription of the relevant section of the District Court Act was not capable of misleading the respondent as to what he had to do to comply with the notice', 'This is not a matter of dispute', 'The question is whether the misdescription involved a failure to meet a requirement made essential by the Act', 'On the true construction of the Act, is it essential that there be no misdescription of the relevant section?', 'Is it the purpose of the legislation that any slip, such as giving a reference to the statutory provision governing pre-judgment interest when what is intended is a reference to the provision governing post-judgment interest, should invalidate the notice?', 'Is this so no matter how clear it might be from other parts of the notice that the claim is for post-judgment interest?', 'The High Court then decided that the defect fell within the scope of s 306 of the Act (at [31]):  Section 306, in its application to bankruptcy notices, makes it plain that some instances of non-compliance with the requirements as to the form of a notice will not invalidate the notice', 'The practical significance of an error or deficiency could vary according to the circumstances of each particular case', 'Errors or deficiencies in compliance with requirements as to form may involve questions of degree as well as of kind', 'At the same time, the decision in Kleinwort Benson shows that an error may be covered by s 306 even though it involves a substantial misstatement of an amount of money', 'It was essential that the bankruptcy notice state the amount claimed', 'Was it essential that the amount be correct?', 'Section 41(5) made it clear that an overstatement, even a large overstatement, would not necessarily invalidate the notice', 'This court concluded that it was not the legislative purpose that a substantial understatement should necessarily invalidate the notice', 'That is to say, accurately stating the amount of interest owing was not a matter of such importance that error necessarily resulted in invalidity', 'In the present case, overstatement or understatement of the amount of post-judgment interest owing would not necessarily have invalidated the notice', 'That is part of the context in which legislative purpose is to be considered in deciding whether the reference to s 83A rather than s 85 was fatal', 'The High Court found that the mistake in the bankruptcy notice was not a breach of an essential requirement of the Act and that s 306 applied to remedy the default (at [32]-[34]):  In Lewis [at [95]] , Gyles J accurately identified the question as whether correct completion of the form prescribed by the regulations in every respect is a requirement made essential by the Act', 'Bearing in mind that, in the present case, the error could not have misled the respondent as to what it was necessary to do in order to comply with the requirements of the notice, it is difficult to understand how, consistently with Kleinwort Benson , the respondent could succeed without an affirmative answer to that question', 'In their dissenting reasons in Lewis , Lee J and Gyles J both gave a detailed account of the 1996 amendments to the Act and Regulations', 'It is unnecessary to repeat what they said in that respect', 'Lee J concluded [at [93]] :     Properly construed, the Act and Regulations do not express an intention to create a new regime of strict compliance imposed on a judgment creditor issuing a bankruptcy notice', 'The tenor of the Act and Regulations is not consistent with that conclusion', 'An attempt has been made to recast the process of issue of a bankruptcy notice in terms more understandable to a judgment debtor, but the essential requirements of a bankruptcy notice remain as they have been stated by bankruptcy legislation over many years', 'Lee J also said [at [97]] :     It cannot be correct that amendments to the Act that left undisturbed s 41(5) and (6) which state that a notice that demands payment of a sum that is unjustified or excessive is only invalid if a debtor gives notice within a prescribed period, introduced a new regime in respect of bankruptcy notices under which a judgment debtor could have such a notice set aside where the amount claimed is due in fact and there is no prospect that the debtor could be misled as to the steps to be taken to comply with the notice', 'The amending Act could not have contemplated that a mistaken citation of the source of entitlement to claim interest would be a substantive defect or irregularity in the notice so as to exclude the operation of s 306 of the Act', 'That view of the legislative purpose is persuasive', 'The effect of the majority view in Lewis is to attribute to the legislature an overwhelming preference for form over substance', 'That should not be done', 'Given that s 306 relieves against the invalidating consequences of some mistakes in the preparation of bankruptcy notices, the mistake that was made in this case falls within its terms', 'Before me, the appellant contended that the calculation of interest requirement is made essential by the Act because:   • the purpose of the requirement is to enable the debtor to verify that the amount claimed is in fact due; • the information required to be provided (namely an interest calculation) is of far greater importance than the requirement under consideration in Adams [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 (to give a precise identification of the provision under which interest is claimed); • in the usual case, the omission has the potential to \"reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice\" --- in the event of an overstatement, the debtor is entitled to pay the actual amount of the debt and not the overstated amount; • in the usual case the omission has the potential to prejudice the debtor\\'s ability to exercise rights under s 41(5) --- in the event of an overstatement, a notice of overstatement must give sufficient information for the creditor to identify what is said to be alleged misstatement', 'Each of the above submissions is presented in the abstract and without consideration of the basis of the claim for interest in the Notice', 'I do not consider it helpful to compare and contrast different types of information that may be included in a notice, and attribute to them lessor or greater importance', 'The task I have is to consider the legislative purpose of the Act and make \"an evaluation of the significance or importance of the error or deficiency in the circumstances of the case\"', 'Assuming that the Notice does not comply (substantially or otherwise) with the requirement to give details of the calculation of the amount of interest, or fails to specify the actual interest rates over the relevant period, in my view it is not an essential requirement of the Act that such details be provided having regard to the following particular circumstances of this case:  • there is and can be no dispute about the amount of interest claimed,  • an order of the Supreme Court of Victoria binding on the debtor has determined (and calculated) the amount of interest claimed,  • the Notice accurately sets out the basis of the claim for interest, namely pursuant to the Supreme Court Act , and has been determined (and calculated) by the Supreme Court of Victoria in the 2006 Orders, and  • there is (and can be) no suggestion that any interest is claimed in the Notice itself otherwise than as set out therein', 'I cannot envisage that the legislative purpose of the Act would be served by concluding that the failure to adhere to the form in the way alleged by the appellant would lead to the Notice being a nullity', 'It would be a classic situation of preferring form over substance to conclude that the Notice was a nullity', 'The whole purpose of the essential requirements of the Act is to inform the debtor clearly and simply of the basis of the debt said to be owed, and this has been achieved', 'In any event, in my view, the calculation of interest in itself is not necessarily an essential requirement of the Act, irrespective of the circumstances of this case', 'In Lewis [2000] FCA 1915 ; 109 FCR 33, Lee J considered the amendments to the Act, which were enacted in 1996, reviewed the legislation and considered whether the calculation of interest was a necessary requirement of a bankruptcy notice', 'His Honour held at [70]-[73]:   Under s 41(2) as it now stands, the Act goes no further than restating that which was formerly provided in s 41(1) , namely that a bankruptcy notice be in accordance with the form prescribed', 'Nothing turns on the fact that the old form was prescribed by rules and the new form prescribed by regulations', 'On its face, therefore, the amendment has made the Act less prescriptive in operation than it was before the amendment', 'In the old notice, identification of the judgment relied upon was essential and was provided for in the form', 'As a matter of practice, costs and interest could be included as part of the sum owing under the judgment provided they were sums for which the creditor could enforce payment by execution, but no further identification of the source of the obligation, other than the judgment, was necessary', '(See Kleinwort Benson at 77; Re Manion; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1979) 23 ALR 270 at 273', ') Identification of the authority to claim costs or interest flowed from identification of the judgment or order relied upon and provision of information in respect of costs and interest was not essential for the debtor to obtain an understanding the requirements of the bankruptcy notice', 'It was suggested in CBC Sydney at 526 that inclusion of particulars of the calculation of interest in the bankruptcy notice was essential to the validity of the notice', 'It is not clear on the authorities referred to in CBC Sydney that such particulars were ever an essential requirement', 'It would appear that there was no greater requirement than that the amount claimed for interest be calculated accurately and recited in the notice and not be claimed as an uncalculated amount', '(See Re Davis; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1963) 19 ABC 100; Re McDonald; Ex parte Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd (1978) 18 ALR 505 at 507', ')   The new notice does not require the judgment or order relied upon to be identified in the body of the notice but par 2 of the substantive part of the notice directed to the debtor states that a copy of the judgment or order relied upon by the creditor is attached', 'It may be said, therefore, that the attachment referred to now performs the essential requirement of the old notice that there be identification of the judgment or order relied upon', 'It can be seen that if a notice does not recite in the body thereof, particulars of the judgment or order relied upon, it may be necessary to provide a copy of the relevant judgment or order for the debtor to understand the requirements of the notice', '(See Haros v National Australia Bank Ltd ( unreported, Federal Court, Ryan J , No 1391 of 1997, 24 November 1997)', ') However, where a creditor is instructed by a note endorsed on the new notice to attach other documents that relate to matters of costs and interest, it does not follow that such an endorsement expresses the intention of Parliament that provision of that material become an essential requirement of the notice', 'Furthermore, the only document required to be lodged with the Official Receiver pursuant to reg 4.01, other than the draft bankruptcy notice and additional copies thereof, is the sealed or certified copy of the judgment or order', 'The Regulations do not require the person applying for the issue of a bankruptcy notice to lodge with the Official Receiver a certificate of the taxed costs or a document showing how interest was calculated if the draft bankruptcy notice includes a claim for costs or interest', 'As noted earlier, the form of bankruptcy notice in force before the amending Act was enacted did not refer to external documents', 'As noted above, reg 4.01 does not require more than one sealed or certified copy of the relevant judgment or order be lodged with the Official Receiver and is silent on whether the Official Receiver retains that document or returns it to the party seeking the issue of a bankruptcy notice', 'Paragraph 2 of the new notice, which seems to place greater reliance on its substance than form, states that a \"copy\" of the judgment or order relied upon is \"attached\" and does not state that the \"attached\" document is a sealed or certified copy of the judgment or order', '(See St George Bank Ltd v Klintworth (1998) 86 FCR 240 at 242)', '(Emphasis added) 34 Justice Gyles agreed with the views of Lee J, and made additional comments at [113]:  It is suggested that the 1996 amendments can be construed by reference to the new regulations', 'I do not agree', 'The regulations do not control the construction of the Act in any way', 'The 1996 amendments to the Act itself have nothing new (or relevant) to say concerning the required content of bankruptcy notices', 'As I have said, the only material change to the Act was to make the position less, rather than more, prescriptive than previously', 'The circumstance that the form now provides for much more information and is more complicated than hitherto would tend against a conclusion that the correctness and completeness of all information is a statutory requisite in the Kleinwort Benson sense', 'The varying nature and importance of the contents of the form which appears from the analysis by Lee J supports this conclusion', 'Delegated legislation is, of course, binding', 'That proposition is of no assistance in deciding whether strict compliance with a form prescribed by delegated legislation is made essential by the Act within the meaning of the majority judgment in Kleinwort Benson', 'Consideration of what was said by the majority at 76 of Kleinwort Benson shows that the phrase \"made essential by the Act\" in this context means what it says, and does not encompass the effect of a form prescribed by the executive government', 'The High Court of Australia in Adams [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 considered all judgments of the court in Lewis [2000] FCA 1915 ; 109 FCR 33', 'After considering the minority decisions of Gyles and Lee JJ, the court approved their approach and applied the legislative purpose test applied by Gyles and Lee JJ (at [33] to [34])', 'I do not conclude, however, that the High Court necessarily approved the comments of Lee J concerning Re Bankruptcy Act 1966 ; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd (1979) 23 ALR 522', 'Further, his comments in this regard were made concerning the old notice prescribed pursuant to s 41(2) of the Act as it was prior to the amendments made in 1996 where there was no requirement in the same terms as note 2 of the new form of the bankruptcy notice, although reflections were made by his Honour on the new notice which impacts upon his views as to what would be expected by the new notice', 'Nevertheless, the observations of Lee J concerning the requirement for a calculation of interest seem to be borne out by my review of the authorities to which he referred in his judgment', 'Even CBC Sydney 23 ALR 522 does not necessarily suggest that the inclusion of particulars of the calculation of interest was essential', 'In my view, the authorities referred to, including CBC Sydney 23 ALR 522, do not enable one to conclude that it was ever an essential requirement to include particulars of the calculation of interest in a bankruptcy notice', 'Undoubtedly the authorities indicate that the calculation must be made accurately, and that the period in which interest is claimed and the amount of interest must be specified in the notice, but they go no further', 'In light then of the approach to the legislative purpose adopted by Lee and Gyles JJ, as approved by the High Court, in my view nothing in the Act indicates that now the calculation itself must be included in the Notice', 'In fact, if it were not a requirement prior to the 1996 amendment, the tendency would be towards the view that providing such information is not now a statutory requirement in the Kleinwort Benson [1988] HCA 34 ; 165 CLR 71 or Adams [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396 sense, if one adopts the approach of Gyles J as referred to above', 'In addition to the above authorities, two other cases need to be mentioned', 'In Re Spurr; Ex parte Werner (1991) 31 FCR 236, Heerey J considered the validity of a bankruptcy notice which stated the amount of interest due but not the rate of interest applied', 'The notice also contained inconsistencies as to whether payment was to be made by the debtor in 14 or 21 days', \"His Honour dismissed the creditors' petition and held that the notice was invalid by reason of the inconsistencies in the notice\", 'As to the calculation of interest, his Honour held at 237:  It seems to me that as long as the bankruptcy notice correctly states the amount of interest which is in fact due, the notice is valid and the debtor fails to pay that amount at his peril', 'No authority was cited which suggests there is any requirement to include in the notice all the information which would be necessary for the debtor to be able to recalculate the amount of interest to his own satisfaction', 'The decision of Heerey J is consistent with the position observed by Lee J and the view I have arrived at after a review of the authorities', 'The position adopted by his Honour is, in my view, currently the correct one', 'In Bendigo Bank Ltd v Gard [1999] FCA 1179 ; (1999) 92 FCR 560, North J in an ex tempore decision considered an appeal from a decision of the registrar regarding the failure to make a sequestration order for non-compliance with a bankruptcy notice, by reason that the notice was defective in that it did not include an interest calculation', 'His Honour considered the decision of Kenny J in American Express International Inc v Held [1999] FCA 321 ; (1999) 87 FCR 583 where her Honour found that failure to attach a copy of the judgment to the bankruptcy notice was a breach of an essential requirement of the Act', 'At [11], North J held that even though there was no precise analogy between the purpose for which the copy judgment is required by the form, and the purpose for which the interest calculation is required, the interest calculation was nevertheless an essential requirement of the Act', 'His Honour found that the bankruptcy notice contained a substantive defect by reason of failing to contain an interest calculation', 'Justice North did not have the advantage of the reasoning in the subsequent cases referred to in this judgment, particularly Adams [2006] HCA 10 ; 225 ALR 396; Lewis [2000] FCA 1915 ; 109 FCR 33 and Snelgrove 157 FCR 313', 'With the benefit of the reasoning in these decisions, North J would have needed to have undertaken an analysis of the failure to comply with note 2 of the Schedule to the form in the context of the Act to determine whether it was an essential requirement', 'Merely equating such a failure to a failure to attach a copy of the judgment to the bankruptcy notice without the further analysis now required, would not be sufficient', 'In the circumstances, I do not regard the decision of North J as one I should follow', 'In any event, the circumstances of the case before me are quite different from those confronting his Honour, for he did not have a binding determination of the Supreme Court of Victoria declaring the amount of interest payable which was the basis of the interest claimed in the bankruptcy notice', 'In view of the above reasons I would conclude that even if the Notice did not substantially comply with the form, then in the circumstances of this case, such compliance was not an essential requirement of the Act', 'No other issue arises in this proceeding as to the operation of s 306(1) of the Act', 'In view of the above, the appeal is dismissed with costs', 'I certify that the preceding forty-four (44) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of

venue, the matter would then need to be listed for directions in Melbourne', 'As to when that would be is a matter beyond my control, but I think I am entitled to infer there would be a likelihood of the listing of the matter for hearing being delayed', \"The fact that the Minister, through his legal representative this morning, did not oppose the application, is a significant matter to be taken into account, although I have to bear in mind that the Minister's views in relation to that have been formed in circumstances where they have not as yet been served with the process by the applicant\", 'Nevertheless, the attitude the Minister adopts of not opposing the applicant is a relevant consideration', 'The convenience of the parties is of course a significant matter and I accept if there is substance in the grounds advanced by the applicant as explaining her departure for Melbourne so soon after the application was filed in the Adelaide registry --- if there is indeed substance in those matters --- the balance of convenience may well lie with her', 'My difficulty at the moment is that the applicant has not given me enough material to enable me to properly evaluate whether the proceedings should be transferred', 'We have got assertions in relation to the fact that the medical treatment is only available in Melbourne, but we need something to substantiate that in terms of either a medical report or the expression of a medical opinion or something of that nature', 'Far more detail would be required in relation to the course that the applicant proposes to attend, and when she proposes to attend it in Melbourne, together with some information explaining what on the face of the material is an odd circumstance of the proceedings being filed here --- and at the risk of repeating myself --- and being followed up so shortly thereafter with the move to Melbourne', 'In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that enough material has been advanced by the applicant to enable me to make the order for transfer', 'Accordingly, the application for the transfer of the venue of the matter set forth in the Application in a Case filed on 19 August 2008, is refused', 'At the end of August 2008 the applicant attempted to appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrate but, I think, lodged the application for leave in the Federal Magistrates Court instead of this Court', 'There was then a delay whilst her application for a fee waiver was being considered', 'As a result, this application was not accepted for filing until 12 February 2009', 'In the meantime, orders were made by the Registrar of the Federal Magistrates Court for the preparation of the Court Book and for filing written submissions', 'The hearing of the application was set for 26 February 2009', 'On 20 January 2009 the applicant sought to have the Court provide a telephone conference so that she could appear at the hearing because she was in Melbourne', 'It would seem from what she wrote that she thought an appeal had then been filed', 'The Court refused her request:  Please be advised you or your legal representative must appear for the hearing of your application for review', 'Should there be no appearance orders may be made in your absence', 'The Court separately sent her the documents to seek a fee waiver and for this application', 'On 12 February 2009 the

oppose the applicant's application to transfer the matter\", 'The first respondent submitted that in considering an application for a transfer of the proceeding on this application the Court must address the indicia in rule 8.01 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001', 'The first respondent also submitted that the Court should not grant leave to appeal without identifying an error of the type described in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-5 or find that the exercise of the discretion by the Federal Magistrate had miscarried', 'The first respondent indicated, however, that if the Court were of the opinion that an extension of time should be granted and leave to appeal be given, then the first respondent would consent to an order for transfer of the proceeding', 'I think, with respect, that the Minister was right to adopt the attitude to which I have referred which, in my opinion, was entirely reasonable', 'Clearly, I would not allow an extension of time unless I were of the opinion that leave should be given and I would not grant leave unless I thought the appeal had reasonable prospects of success', 'However, if the application were granted and leave given, I could hear the appeal instanter: s 25(1AA) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth)', \"The application is late and is against an order made in the exercise of the Court's discretion in a matter of practice and procedure\", 'The obstacles facing the applicant are therefore high', 'In House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ said:  The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be determined is governed by established principles', 'It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course', 'It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion', 'If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so', 'It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance', 'In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred', 'In Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 177, the Court said:  Nor is there any serious dispute between the parties that appellate courts exercise particular caution in reviewing decisions pertaining to practice and procedure', 'Counsel for Brown urged that specific cumulative bars operate to guide appellate courts in the discharge of that task', 'Not only must there be error of principle, but the decision appealed from must work a substantial injustice to one of the parties', 'The

(b) a judgment or order that is enforceable as, or in the same manner as, a final judgment obtained in an action shall be deemed to be a final judgment so obtained and the proceedings in which, or in consequence of which, the judgment or order was obtained shall be deemed to be the action in which it was obtained;  Section 41(1)(a), (2) and (7) of the 1966 Act provides as follows:  Bankruptcy notices  (1) An Official Receiver may issue a bankruptcy notice on the application of a creditor who has obtained against a debtor: (a) a final judgment or final order that: (i) is of the kind described in paragraph 40(1)(g); and (ii) is for an amount of at least $2,000... ...

respond to an invitation to do so on the advice of a person they had retained, a Mr Hussain', 'That person had wrongly represented himself to be a solicitor and a migration agent', 'The fraud of the agent, it was concluded, had the effect that the decision of the Tribunal was no decision at all', 'Although the Tribunal was unaware of the fraud of the agent, the result of his fraud was that the applicants had been denied such natural justice as was afforded by the Migration Act 1958 (Cth)', 'In reaching this conclusion Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ addressed as follows the influence of the \" red blooded \" species of fraud upon the development of public law:  [12] The attachment by courts of equity of the term \"fraud\", with related notions of \"bad faith\" and \"abuse of power\", when stigmatising exercises of powers of appointment and fiduciary powers as falling short of the standards equity required of the repositories of those powers, has proved influential in the development of public law', 'What came to be known as the principle of \" Wednesbury unreasonableness\" was developed in the case law by analogy to the principles controlling the exercise of powers of discretions vested in trustees and others [ Minister for Immigration v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611]', '[13] However, several points should be made here', 'First, given the equitable nature of their origins described above, principles of public law concerning impropriety in the exercise of statutory powers have not had the focus upon what might be called the \"red blooded\" species of fraud which engages the common law', 'Secondly, with respect to references in the public law decisions to good and bad faith and the like, the following observation in a leading English text [Wade and Forsyth, Administrative Law (9th ed, 2004)] is in point:  \"These add very little to the true sense, and are hardly ever used to mean more than that some action is found to have a lawful or unlawful purpose', 'It is extremely rare for public authorities to be found guilty of intentional dishonesty: normally they are found to have erred, if at all, by ignorance or misunderstanding', 'Yet the courts constantly accuse them of bad faith merely because they have acted unreasonably or on improper grounds', 'Again and again it is laid down that powers must be exercised reasonably and in good faith', 'But in this context \"in good faith\" means merely \"for legitimate reasons\"', 'Contrary to the natural sense of the words, they impute no moral obliquity', '\"   Aickin J made observations to similar effect in R v Toohey; Ex parte Northern Land Council [1981] HCA 74 ; [(1981) 151 CLR 170]', '[14] Thirdly, in the present case the appellants do not challenge the description by French J of the Tribunal as having acted \"blamelessly\" [2006] FCAFC 142 ; [(2006) 154 FCR 365]', 'But the appellants do direct attention to the effect upon the processes of the Tribunal of the dishonest acts and omissions of a third party, Mr Hussain', 'In this regard, the appellants pray in aid another generally expressed precept drawn from private law and from the significance of dishonesty in the litigation of private rights', 'This is expressed in the oft-repeated proposition that whilst on one hand fraud may be infinite, on the other hand \"fraud unravels everything\"', 'The submission advanced on behalf of Mr Harding was understood to be that, just as the conduct of Mr Hussain had deprived the applicants in SZFDE of the opportunity to be heard before the Refugee Review Tribunal, the conduct of the solicitor had deprived Mr Harding of his opportunity to be heard before the District Court', 'The submission was that Mr Harding was \" lied to or at least misled by the Respondent\\'s legal representative about the utility of his cross claim before Kearns DCJ \"', 'The submission is to be rejected', 'Whether or not Mr Harding should have applied to the District Court to have the judgment set aside, as was contended by the Deputy Commissioner, may be left to one side', 'Also left to one side is whether the approach pursued in SZFDE may be extended so as to potentially vitiate proceedings before a court as opposed to an administrative tribunal', 'The submission is to be rejected upon the more fundamental basis that the conduct of the solicitor is in no way comparable to that of Mr Hussain', 'It is not considered that Mr Harding was \" lied to or at least misled \"', 'The extent of the detail provided by Mr Harding to the solicitor is unknown', 'But even if the solicitor had been told such detail as to Mr McClure\\'s conduct as was explained in the present proceeding, the solicitor\\'s statement that that conduct \" had no relevance \" was accurate if the solicitor was directing attention to the issues then before the District Court', 'Mr Harding certainly had not been \" lied to \"', 'On the basis of the statement of claim as filed in the District Court and upon the basis of the defence as filed, the conduct of Mr McClure was irrelevant to the issues then before that Court', 'Nor is it considered that Mr Harding was \" misled \"', 'It was no part of the duty of the solicitor then appearing for the Deputy Commissioner to give advice to the then defendant, Mr Harding, as to either the prospect of a claim being made against the Commonwealth or even advice confined to the prudence of Mr Harding getting independent legal advice', 'The Australian Government Solicitor is established pursuant to s 55J of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth)', 'That Act further provides for the issue by the Attorney-General of Legal Services Directions : s 55ZF', 'Directions have in fact been issued requiring the Commonwealth and its legal representatives to act as a \" model litigant \"', 'No particular provision of the Directions was relied upon by the Applicant', 'But it is not considered that the standards of a \" model litigant \" extend to imposing any general duty to give advice to an opponent as to the prospect of resisting a claim being advanced by the Commonwealth, or even a duty to suggest that independent advice be obtained', 'Whether or not the duty of a \" model litigant \" may in some particular circumstances embrace such a duty need not be resolved', 'Considerable caution should be exercised before imposing any such duty upon solicitors within the Australian Government Solicitor', 'Confined to the circumstances of the present proceeding, there was scant evidence as to what the solicitor had in fact been told by Mr Harding', 'Even assuming that Mr Harding had told the solicitor the entirety of his dealings with Mr McClure and his subsequent conversations with officers of the Australian Taxation Office, it is not considered, even on that assumption, that there was any requirement upon the solicitor to proffer advice', 'No source of any requirement to proffer advice or give assistance to Mr Harding was identified other than the requirement to act as a \" model litigant \"', 'No authority was cited which supported the imposition of any such requirement upon a \" model litigant \"', 'It is not considered that Mr Harding was deprived of any opportunity to have his case resolved by the District Court', 'The conduct of the solicitor can in no way be equated with the conduct of Mr Hussain in SZFDE', 'COUNTER-CLAIM OR CROSS DEMAND: MISREPRESENTATION?', 'The submission that Mr Harding had a \" counter-claim \" or \" cross demand \" by reason of misrepresentation is also to be rejected', 'The \" counter-claim \" or \" cross demand \" relied upon by Mr Harding was said to be either: a claim for \" misrepresentation \", namely a misrepresentation that Mr Harding had the benefit of a GST exemption issued by the Australian Taxation Office; or an action in the nature of judicial review to have the assessments or amended assessments upon which the District Court proceeded to enter judgment set aside and declared void', 'Each limb to the submission must be rejected', 'Counsel for Mr Harding properly accepted that no case in misrepresentation which was actionable as against the Australian Taxation Officer, or the Deputy Commissioner, could be sustained if the evidence was confined to the statements apparently made by Mr McClure', 'Statements made by him as to the authority or the agency he was professing could not be attributed to the present Respondent merely by reason of those statements alone', 'It was for this reason that Counsel accepted that he needed the evidence of a conversation with an officer of the Australian Taxation Office only able to be identified as \" Laura \"', 'It was her evidence, so it was contended, that effectively meant that the misrepresentations made by Mr McClure could be attributed to the Respondent', 'Having attended the seminars conducted by Mr McClure, Mr Harding also telephoned the Tax Office and asked to speak to a \" GST information officer \"', 'He was put through to an officer named \" Laura \"', 'Mr Harding apparently explained to the officer the purpose of his call, namely to \" check that what I had been told was accurate and could be relied on \"', 'In his Affidavit dated 10 October 2008, Mr Harding set forth the following conversation with \" Laura \":  Mr Harding:   \"I have attended seminars by Mr Malcolm McClure on the GST; and I propose to purchase one of the GST exemption packages\"', 'The officer said:   \"We have got thousands of people working for the ATO and we have agents who are working for us', 'We do have agents out there', 'What are you after?', '\"   Mr Harding said:   \"What is this GST exemption and how does such a package work?', '\"   The officer replied:   \"Yes we do have those', 'Are you proposing to apply for that?', '\"   Mr Harding said:   \"Yes', '\"   He then asked:   \"Are the GST exemption packages bona fide and are they authorized by the ATO\"   The officer replied:   \"Yes, they are bona fide and they are available to small businesses', 'It is a GST exemption which is a private binding agreement with the business', '\"   Mr Harding then said:   \"Are there any limits monetary wise to the GST exemption?', '\"   The officer replied:   \"No, there is no limit', '\"   To corroborate the fact that such a conversation took place, a Mr Williams gave evidence and was cross-examined', 'Mr Williams had purchased a car battery from Mr Harding and was present when the conversation took place', 'The evidence of Mr Williams during his evidence in chief was as follows:  MR KING: And can you remember whether or not anything else was said in the conversation?---No, so long ago, you know', \"We were talking about it and he said about the GST and he mentioned Mr McClure, I'm pretty sure he did, but they said they give the exemptions out and there was no money, no limits or anything involved you know, so I thought that was quite interesting because I think that's what the Tax Office was talking about in public at one stage because I'd seen a program regarding that\", 'Attempts made by the Respondent to locate the officer merely identified by the name \" Laura \", not surprisingly, proved unsuccessful', 'Having received what he thought was corroboration from \" Laura \", Mr Harding then paid Mr McClure $2,000 and received in the mail a \" GST exemption \" card', 'That card took the following form on its face:  The text on the reverse of the card was difficult to read but was as follows:  The text, if read, may well have been sufficient to put people on notice as to its authenticity or reliability', 'Meaning no disrespect to Mr Harding, he was a person with limited ability to read', 'It was his genuine belief that he had got what he paid for --- a GST exemption', 'He included on at least one of the tax invoices issued in September 2002 a disclosure of his \" ABN \" and the \" GST Exemption \" number as disclosed on the card', 'There was also some evidence that Mr Harding had disclosed to another officer of the Australian Taxation Office, a Mr David Scott, his belief that he had a GST exemption', 'In his Affidavit dated 10 October 2008, Mr Harding set forth the following conversation with Mr Scott:  Mr Scott:   \"We seem to have an issue about you collecting GST', '\"   Mr Harding:   \"Yes', 'I have an exemption', '\"   Mr Scott:   \"What is that about?', '\"   Mr Harding:   \"I will get Malcolm McClure to call you', '\"   Mr Scott:   \"That will be good\"', 'Some six weeks later, Mr Harding maintained there was a further conversation along the following lines:  Mr Harding:   \"Have you heard from Malcolm McClure?', '\"   Mr Scott   \"No, but I will give you my mobile number to give to him\"', 'Mr Harding then contacted Mr McClure who said he would \" get right on to it \"', 'In cross-examination, Mr Scott denied that he had been told by Mr Harding about either the existence of Mr McClure or the claimed GST exemption', 'Upon the assumption that \" a taxpayer claimed an exemption from collecting GST \", Mr Scott accepted that \" if the client had made that statement ... --- and provided the names --- who it was from the ATO, I would have checked with that officer, and I would have asked for a copy of the exemption \"', 'Such divergence as there is, as between the evidence of Mr Harding and Mr Scott, is to be resolved in favour of Mr Harding', 'It is accepted that he did disclose to Mr Scott the identity of Mr McClure and the fact that he claimed he had a GST exemption', 'To Mr Harding, it was a matter of importance', 'Moreover, it was not put to Mr Harding in cross-examination that such a conversation did not occur, and another officer present with Mr Scott when the telephone conversation took place was not called', 'No case was sought to be advanced that the conversation with \" Laura \" amounted to a misrepresentation', 'The case that was sought to be advanced was that the conversation with \" Laura \", and possibly the conversation with Mr Scott, together with the earlier misrepresentations of Mr McClure, were sufficient', 'The submission that the present Respondent, or possibly the Australian Taxation Office more generally, is to be held accountable for the representations made by Mr McClure is to be rejected', \"Counsel for Mr Harding was quite correct in disavowing any suggestion that Mr McClure's own statements were sufficient to establish any counter-claim or cross demand\", 'And the conversation with \" Laura \", it is considered, took the matter no further', 'Nothing that was said by \" Laura \" could be construed as any endorsement that Mr McClure was an agent of the Australian Taxation Office, or as any endorsement that the \" GST exemption \" being canvassed by Mr McClure was an exemption authorised by that Office', 'No details were provided to \" Laura \" upon which any such endorsement could be founded', 'The purported GST exemption number, for example, was not mentioned; nor were any further details either provided to or requested by \" Laura \" in order to verify that which Mr Harding believed', 'It was no more than a statement that the Australian Taxation Office did have GST exemptions for small business', 'There is not considered to be any nexus as between the conduct of Mr McClure and the present Respondent', 'The conversation with Mr Scott, likewise, took the matter no further', 'Whatever was said by Mr McClure could not be attributed to the present Respondent or the Australian Taxation Office more generally', 'COUNTER-CLAIM OR CROSS DEMAND: JUDICIAL REVIEW?', 'The alternative basis upon which it was contended on behalf of Mr Harding that there was a \" counter-claim \" or \" cross demand \" which could not have been set up as against the claim of the Deputy Commissioner, was the contention that there was available to Mr Harding the prospect of seeking judicial review of those decisions necessarily taken by the Deputy Commissioner prior to commencing the proceedings in the District Court', 'The statement of claim as filed in the District Court stated that a \" Running Balance Account \" was established pursuant to s 8AAZC of the Taxation Administration Act in respect of primary tax debts due by Mr Harding', 'Primary tax debts were allocated to the \" Running Balance Account \" pursuant to s 8AAZD', 'The statement of claim further stated that Mr Harding became liable to pay a general interest charge pursuant to s 8AAZF and that Mr Harding ultimately became liable to pay monies pursuant to s 8AAZH in respect to the sum of $332,943.86', 'The statement of claim also alleged that there had been a failure to lodge income tax returns and that by reason of s 286-75 of the 1953 Act, Mr Harding had become liable to pay a further penalty', 'Before the District Court there were tendered a number of assessments served by the Deputy Commissioner upon Mr Harding', 'Each of those assessments was expressed to have been made under s 22(1) of the Taxation Administration Act', 'The application in the nature of judicial review was not formulated with any degree of precision', 'Indeed, it was formulated with no greater precision in the written submissions than a statement that:  ... As for the invalidity point, that required a collateral attack on the decision to issue the amended assessments, and that could only be brought in the Federal Court under Judiciary Act 1901 as the public officer concerned is an officer of the Commonwealth not the State of NSW ...   This alternative submission is also to be rejected for a number of reasons', 'First, it is far from certain that an application seeking judicial review of decisions to issue assessments or amended assessments, upon which a judgment for a monetary sum has been entered, is a \" counter-claim, set-off or cross demand \" within the meaning of s 40(1)(g)', 'In support of the contrary conclusion, it was understood that Counsel on behalf of Mr Harding contended that the term \" cross demand \" was not a technical term but rather a term which should not be given any confined meaning: In re Judd; Ex parte Pike (1924) 24 SR (NSW) 537', 'But, whatever the meaning to be given to the term, it has to date been held that an action \" must be something sounding in money \": Re Brink; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd (1980) 44 FLR 135 at 138 per Lockhart J', 'See also: Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 at 85 per Henchman J', 'An application seeking declaratory relief as to an entitlement to a charge on the proceeds of property has thus been said not to be a \" counter-claim, set-off or cross demand \": In re A Bankruptcy Notice [1934] 1 Ch 431', 'See also: Massih v Esber [2008] FCA 1452 at [22] ---[24]', 'A more modern instance of that which may fall within the statutory phrase is provided by Re Zakrzewski;

and the acknowledgment on the part of Mr Scott that, had he known of the claimed GST exemption, he would have made further inquiries', 'But neither consideration was a consideration that Mr Scott was bound to take into account or further pursue: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39---41 per Mason J, even assuming that all that Mr Harding had to establish was a ground of review falling short of jurisdictional error', 'COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SET UP IN THE ACTION OR PROCEEDING?', 'The rejection of the two suggested \" cross-claims \" or \" cross demands \" as formulated on behalf of Mr Harding makes it unnecessary to address the further submission as to whether any such \" counter-claim \" or \" cross demand \" \" could ... have [been] set up in the action or proceeding \" in the District Court', 'The requirement imposed by s 40(1)(g) that the \" counter-claim, set-off or cross demand \" be one which \" could not have [been] set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained \" is a requirement which refers to the ability to set up the claim, set-off or demand as a matter of law', 'A mere failure to take advantage of an opportunity to do so does not fall within s 40(1)(g): Re Vicini;
